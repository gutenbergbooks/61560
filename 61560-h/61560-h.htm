<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This treatise on the diseases of horses has been
written with the primary purpose of placing in the hands
of the Student and the Veterinary Profession, a book
of practical worth; hence, all unnecessary padding is
omitted, so that the reader may quickly grasp the knowledge
of the subject or disease for which he may be
seeking.</p>

<p>The treatment suggested in each case is one I have
used and found efficient in my many years of practice.</p>

<p>If my readers will study and follow the directions
carefully, they will save themselves, as well as their
neighbors, much unnecessary loss. My confidence in
this accomplishment is my reward for my labor in behalf
of our faithful servant the Horse.</p>

<h2>THE USE OF THE CLINICAL THERMOMETER</h2>

<p>This instrument is employed for taking the internal
temperature of the body, which is most conveniently
done by placing the instrument for about three minutes
in the animal’s rectum. Owing to the almost general
adoption of this method, the expression “internal temperature”
is used as a rule to signify “rectal temperature”;
although the respective temperatures of different
parts of the body vary to a slight extent. The practice
of placing the thermometer in the mouth, as is the custom
in human medicine, is not suitable to animals, owing
to the danger of the patient breaking the glass instrument
with the teeth.</p>

<p>The indications afforded by the clinical thermometer
are valuable guides as to the state of the animal’s health
at the time, or what it will shortly be. Thus, in a horse
at rest under ordinary conditions, if there be a rise of
three or four degrees without the animal evincing any
other sign of illness, we may be assured that disease in
some form will, after a day or two, manifest itself in him.
During illness, a temperature of, say, 106° F. or more
points to a condition of great danger.</p>

<p>The clinical thermometer is especially useful in indicating
the state of an animal during infective diseases
and diseases of the organs of breathing. A fall in temperature,
when it has been abnormally high, will generally
point to a favorable termination of the disease; although
in some cases it is the precursor of rapidly approaching
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h2>TEMPERATURE DURING HEALTH.</h2>

<p>As a rule, there is a daily variation in the internal
temperature of a healthy animal of about 1° F.; the
maximum being attained at about 6 o’clock in the evening.
In the adult animal, the temperature is about 1°
F. higher than in a very young or very old animal. It
is about 1° F. less in the female than in the male, except
when she is “in season,” during which time it is about
2° F. higher than normal. The temperature of well-bred
animals is higher than that of common animals. A
rise of 4° or 5° F., compatible with health, may be observed
in animals during violent exercise or work in hot
weather. The temperature of well-fed animals is higher
than that of poorly-fed ones. During digestion, it rises
about 1° F., and falls about the same amount during
sleep. Exposure to the rays of a hot sun for a few hours
may cause a rise of as much as 3° F., and the effects of
cold and rain may equally lower it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Normal Temperature of the Horse.</span>—</p>

<p>From 2 to 5 years old the temperature is 100.6° F.</p>

<p>From 5 to 10 years old the temperature is 100.4° F.</p>

<p>From 10 to 15 years old the temperature is 100° F.</p>

<p>From 15 to 20 years old the temperature is 98.4° to
100.2° F.</p>

<p>New born foals’ temperature will run from 102° to
104° F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of Cattle.</span>—Normal temperature is
from 101.8° to 102° F. Compared with the horse, the
daily variations are small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of Sheep and Goats.</span>—In these animals
the greatest variation in temperature occurs, viz.:
100.9° to 105.8° F. In the majority of cases the temperatu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>re
probably will be between 103.6° and 104.4° F. The
cause of this variation is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of Swine.</span>—The average temperature
is 103.3° F., varying from 100.9° to 105.4° F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of the Dog.</span>—The dog is subject to
important variations depending on the external temperature;
it varies from 99.5° to 101.7° F., although in some
localities it is as high as 100.9° to 101.3° F. Feeding will
increase the temperature, and it is also higher towards
evening.</p>

<h2>PULSE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Pulse Feeling.</span>—Pulse are usually taken at the
lower jaw; its character there being better marked than
at other convenient situations. The artery may be felt
underneath the lower jaw, just in front of the fleshy part
of the cheek. On passing the fingers of the hand over
the spot, two vessels can be distinguished lying closely
together; one, the duct which conveys saliva from the
parotid gland into the mouth; the other, the artery which
supplies the face with blood. The middle finger should
be applied so as to gently press the artery against the inner
surface of the bone. The ball of the thumb should
not be placed on the outside of the jaw, lest the operator
might mistake the pulsation of the artery of his thumb
for that of the patient’s artery.</p>

<p>Very frequently the indication of the artery of the
fore-arm is the one adopted. This vessel is on the inner
side of the fore-arm, and may be felt by inserting the
hand, from the front, between the breast and fore-arm,
and feeling for the slightly prominent head of the bone
just below the elbow joint.</p>

<p>The pulse can be felt at other parts of the body, but
those mentioned are more practical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pulse.</span>—The pulse in the horse, as in other animals,
is of great importance; it tells the number and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
force of the heart beats. When taking pulse endeavor to
keep the animal as quiet as possible, for if you excite
him, you will find the pulse increased several beats, and
after standing some time it will again fall. Pulse varies
in different animals; slower in heavier horses, quicker
in highly nervous animals. It may vary five or ten beats
per minute, and the animal still be in perfect health.
There are various kinds of pulsations, as the result of certain
diseases, the quick, slow, large, hard, soft, frequent
and infrequent. The strong, full pulse may be present,
and consistent with good health; exercise will change the
pulse to a considerable extent. But if the animal is suffering
from disease, and then the pulse is of a wiry character,
it is characteristic of the sthenic type of inflammation.
Suppose an animal has been standing in the stable,
and is attacked with lymphangitis, the pulse is
full, bounding, wiry, characteristic of inflammation of
the bowels, punctures of the feet, inflammation of the
joints, etc. The weak, small pulse is indicative of debility,
showing inflammation of an esthetic type. It may
occur in influenza and catarrh. The oppressed pulse is
characteristic of congestion and inflammation of the
lungs; you would think the heart had great difficulty in
propelling the blood forward. The throbbing pulse is
characteristic of inflammation in certain parts. In laminitis
there is, perhaps, the best example of the throbbing
pulse, beating quickly, with a peculiar throbbing sensation,
especially in any inflammatory action in the vascular
structures of the feet, making the circulation difficult.
A slow pulse is characteristic of cerebral disease,
but if only twenty-eight or thirty you may say at once it
is cerebral disease; if it is accompanied by a comatose
condition, then it is indicative of this disease. The intermitting
pulse is found where the animal has suffered
from some debilitating disease, as influenza, distemper,
catarrh, etc. Although it must in some cases be looked
upon with suspicion, it is not generally very alarming,
but if there is a change for the worse, and this pulse, it is
unfavorable. The fluttering and almost imperceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
pulse indicates great change in the system, as in the latter
stages of enteritis (inflammation of the bowels), pleurisy,
pneumonia, etc., especially in enteritis; if a case where the
pulse is forty, fifty or sixty per minute, and changes,
and runs up to eighty or a hundred and becomes indistinct,
it is indicative of approaching dissolution. These
are the varieties of pulse, and due to the manner in which
disease attacks the various organs. You may meet with
a case at one hundred and twenty-five where it may recover,
but higher than this will no doubt prove fatal. The
pulse in the young is much more rapid than in the adult
animal; that of a foal at birth beats one hundred to one
hundred and two per minute, while that of a calf will go
to one hundred and thirty per minute. In old age the
pulsation becomes reduced and the arteries much weaker.
The pulse rate in large animals is less than in smaller
ones, as for instance, an elephant’s pulse rate is from
twenty-five to twenty-eight beats per minute. The more
rapid the pulse, the greater the quantity of blood in circulation.</p>

<p>By taking the pulse we can form some idea of the
character of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2>ABORTION IN MARES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Quality and quantity of food, poorly
lighted, ventilated or drained stables, mare falling or
slipping, sprains, kicks, hard, fast work or eating poisonous
vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Mare will show signs of colic, the outer
portion of the womb will be swollen, and if the colicky
symptoms continue there will be a watery discharge
and the membranes covering the foetus or foal will become
noticeable. The animal strains when lying down
or getting up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the animal in comfortable quarters
and blanket if chilly. When colicky pains are
present treat the same as for spasmodic colic. To stop
the straining and labor pains, give Tincture Opii one
ounce, placing in gelatin capsule and give with capsule
gun every two hours. One to two doses, however, are
generally sufficient as the mare will either abort or the
dangerous period will have passed. Keep the animal
quiet and feed good nutritious food and pure water with
chill taken off in small quantities but often. Disinfect
the mare’s quarters thoroughly. A good general tonic
should be used in this condition, one that will strengthen
and assist nature to throw off impurities from the blood,
such as Sodium Hyposulphite, eight ounces; Potassi
Iodide, one ounce. Make into eight powders and give
one powder two or three times a day in drinking water.</p>

<h2>ABSCESS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Bruises and injuries. Abscesses are also
seen in complications with various diseases, perhaps the
most common being distemper, laryngitis, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Symptoms will vary, of course, according
to the development of the disease. It may not be
noticed at first, but upon careful examination small
tortuous lines will be observed running from the point of
irritation. In many cases a swelling is noticed which is
hot, painful and throbbing and enlarges rapidly. In
two or three days the soreness and heat gradually subside,
but the abscess continues to grow. The hair falls
from the affected parts and in a short time the abscess
discharges, and the cavity gradually fills up and heals
by granulation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In all cases hasten the ripening process
as much as possible by applying hot water packs
or hot bran, flaxseed or vegetable poultices. It will usually
be found a safe plan to encourage the full ripening of
an abscess and allow it to open of its own accord, as it will
heal much better and quicker and you take no chances
of infection with an instrument. When opened do not
squeeze the abscess to any extent, but press gently with
clean hands or cloth, to remove the clot, and after this
simply keep open by washing the abscess with a three
per cent Carbolic Acid solution or Bichloride of Mercury,
one part to one thousand parts of water. When
an animal has abscesses it is well to give the following
blood purifiers or internal antiseptics: Hyposulphite of
Soda, eight ounces; Potassi Iodide, one ounce. Mix well
and make into eight powders and give one powder twice
daily in drinking water, or place in gelatin capsule and
administer with capsule gun. This prescription will
prevent the absorption of impurities from the abscess
into the blood.</p>

<h2>ANEMIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Insufficient quality and quantity of food,
insanitary surroundings, overwork, lack of exercise,
drains on the system from acute or chronic diseases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
worms; and can also be brought about by excessive heat,
cold or pressure and lessening of the calibre of the
arteries, poisons in the blood, suppurating wounds, repeated
purging or bleedings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The visible mucous membranes of the
nose, eyes and mouth are pale and sometimes have a
yellow appearance. There is weakness, temperature of
the body is lower than normal; pulse weak, legs cold to
the feet, cold sweats are often present, breathing is
quickened, especially in its last stages, animals tire
easily, appetite and digestion become poor, swelling of
the legs and the under surface of the abdomen, sheath
and udder; the skin becomes rough and dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause if possible in its
first stages, or when first noticed. Give a physic of
Calomel, two scruples; Aloin, two drams; Pulv. Gentian,
two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule
and give at one dose with capsule gun. Also, administer
the following: Arsenious Acid, one dram; Ferri Sulphate,
three ounces; Pulv. Gentian, three ounces; Pulv.
Fenugreek Seed, three ounces, and Pulv. Anise Seed,
three ounces. Mix well and make into twenty powders.
Give one powder three times a day in feed, or place in
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Endeavor
to build up the condition of the animal by the proper
quantity and quality of food. Give pure water to drink,
also provide sanitary conditions, as pure air, sunlight if
possible. Turn out to grass when the weather is favorable.
This treatment should be continued until the animal
shows sign of improvement. However, the administration
of physics should be given with great care so as
not to produce superpurgation of the bowels (scours),
as physics in this condition would tend to weaken the
animal.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that pure water and nourishing
food play a very important part in the treatment
of Anemia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h2>APHTHAE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Sore mouth and tongue—Pustular Stomatitis</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Superficial eruptions of the mucous membranes
of the mouth and tongue. Frequently seen during
convalescence of intermittent fever. This condition
may also follow diseases of the digestive system, as Indigestion,
etc., due to the blood absorbing toxic materials
which break out in the form of pustules about the
mouth and the whole alimentary canal (stomach and intestines).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The appetite is impaired, the mouth
hot, the pulse not much affected as a rule, the temperature
is slightly elevated, the animal is unable to masticate,
and small vesicles appear and eventually terminate into
pustules and burst and discharge a small amount of pus
at the parts where the sores are the deepest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause if possible. Feed
clean, soft food that is easily digested, as hot wheat bran
mashes and steamed rolled oats, vegetables, etc. For a
mouth-wash dissolve the following: One dram of Copper
Sulphate, one dram of Chlorate of Potash, one dram
of Boracic Acid in clean hot water, and syringe out the
mouth two or three times a day. To the drinking water
add one ounce of Hyposulphite of Soda twice a day.
Where the appetite is impaired, administer the following:
Pulv. Nux Vomica, Pulv. Gentian Root, Pulv.
Iron, Pulv. Nitrate of Potash each two ounces. Mix and
make into sixteen capsules and give one capsule three
times a day with capsule gun.</p>

<h2>AZOTURIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This disease is usually due to work after a
period of idleness, during which the animal has been
liberally fed. It is found principally among highly-fed
draft horses, and never in animals which are regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
worked. Light breeds of horses are also susceptible to
this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Attack is sudden and usually appears
when the horse has traveled a short distance after having
been stabled for a few days. The characteristic
symptoms of this disease in an animal are: Excitability
without apparent cause; actions seem to indicate injury
of the hind quarters or loins. Animal has a peculiar
goose-rumped look, owing to the muscles over the
quarters being violently contracted, and are hard on
pressure. One hind limb is generally advanced in front
of the other, and on attempting to put weight on it, the
hind quarters will drop until at times the hocks almost
touch the ground. Sometimes a front leg is affected.
The breathing is hurried. Animal is bathed in sweat,
and is in such agony that it will seize almost anything
with its teeth. Although the pulse is hard and frequent,
the internal temperature, even in severe cases, seldom
rises to any marked extent. The urine is dark-red to
dirty-brown color. Owing to the stoppage of the worm-like
movement of the bowels, there is generally constipation
and retention of the urine. Sometimes the symptoms
are milder than here described. In other cases
the animal soon falls to the ground and continues to
struggle in a delirious, half-paralyzed state until he dies.
Sometimes this disease is mistaken for colic or acute
indigestion, but it can be readily distinguished by the
color of the urine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—At the first symptom, stop and
blanket the animal and let stand from one to three hours.
Then move to the nearest shelter, keeping the animal as
quiet and comfortable as possible, as excitement aggravates
the disease. Give Aloin, two drams; Ginger,
two drams, in capsule, and administer with capsule gun.
Also, give the following prescription: Potassi Nitrate,
eight ounces; Sodii Bicarbonate, eight ounces; Potassi
Iodide, one and one-half ounces. Mix well and make into
thirty-two powders. Give one powder in drinking water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
every four hours, or in capsule, and give with capsule
gun. Injections of soap and warm water per rectum
are beneficial. Immerse a blanket in hot water and
place over loins, then covering with a dry blanket, or,
if this is impossible, apply the following liniment: Aqua
Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Turpentine, two ounces;
Sweet Oil, four ounces, and rub in like a shampoo over
the loins. It may be necessary to draw off the urine,
which is sometimes retained. Allow the animal to drink
often, though in small quantities, of pure water with
the chill taken off. If he is unable to stand on his feet
it is well to turn him from side to side every six hours.
It is also advisable to fill bags with hay and place against
his shoulders to prevent him from lying flat on his side,
as this may cause congestion of the lungs. Avoid drenching—it
is dangerous. Should the animal show signs of
uneasiness, give one ounce of Potassi Bromide in the
drinking water every four hours until the excitement
has subsided.</p>

<h2>BARRENNESS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Failure to Breed</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Contraction of the neck of the womb,
growths on or in the ovaries, Whites or Leucorrhea. The
first is the only form of barrenness which responds
readily to treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A mare may come in heat normally, or
stay in heat continually, or not come in heat at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Wash the hands in some antiseptic
solution, such as Carbolic Acid or Bichloride of Mercury,
and see that the finger-nails are smooth. Grease
the hand and arm with vaseline and proceed to dilate
the neck of the womb. It may be difficult at first to insert
the finger, but the opening will gradually enlarge.
Work slowly and carefully until three fingers may be
inserted. Breeding should follow about three hours
after the womb has been dilated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>BLEEDING.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Hemorrhage</i>)</p>

<p>Bleeding sometimes follows operations as castration
and wounds due to various causes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When bleeding from a large artery,
it should be tied with a clean silk or linen thread or twisted
with a pair of forceps or cauterized with a hot iron.
Sometimes compression by the use of tightly bound bandages
proves effective, although the former appliances
are more practical. Tincture chloride of iron, applied
to small arteries or veins, causes the blood to clot in the
arteries or veins, and hence stops the hemorrhage. It is
very essential that all wounds should be treated antiseptically
and I cannot say that I am in favor of washing a
wound with water only in cases where the wound is very
filthy, and I prefer powder applications in preference
to any liquid antiseptics. The following will be found
very effective in the treatment of the majority of
wounds: Boracic acid, two ounces; iodoform, two
drams; tannic acid, two ounces; calomel, one dram;
powder finely and mix well. Place in sifter top can and
apply two or three times daily.</p>

<h2>BLOOD POISONING.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Septicaemia or Pyemia</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—By the popular term, “Blood Poison,” is
meant a state of constitutional disturbance brought on
by the entrance of putrid products—usually from a
wound—into the blood. As a rule some pressure or
inoculation is necessary for the introduction of poison
into the circulation; hence, the necessity of free drainage
and thorough disinfection of the wound, and the only
hopeful cases are those in which by this means the supply
of poison may be cut short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—It is introduced through any wound or
abrasion, whether due to injury, disease or by an operation.
Signs of septic poison are heat, pain and swelling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—It is necessary to see that the wound
has good drainage, and wash with Carbolic Acid, one
tablespoonful to one pint of distilled water or Bichloride
of Mercury perhaps is the best in an infected wound.
Apply one part to one thousand parts water. Also, give
internally, Potassi Iodide, one ounce; Sodii Hyposulphite,
eight ounces. Make into eight powders and give
one powder two or three times a day in their drinking
water or in capsule, and give with capsule gun. This is
an intestinal antiseptic which is very valuable in the
treatment of Blood Poisoning. Feed soft, laxative food
and green grass, if possible.</p>

<h2>BOG SPAVIN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Faulty conformation, slipping, falling
through a bridge or culvert; large loosely built draft
horses are prone to this blemish. Bog Spavin is hereditary,
and you should, therefore, select a good type of
animal for breeding purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A puffy swelling located in front and
on the inside of the hock, varying from the size of a walnut
to that of a man’s fist. It very seldom causes lameness,
but is a serious disfigurement and blemish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Treatment is not satisfactory unless
taken in its first stages and when the animal is young.
If there is heat, pain and swelling, apply cold water or
ice packs until the inflammation has left the parts. Then
use the following prescription: Tincture of Iodine, two
ounces; Gum Camphor, two ounces, Gasolene, one pint.
Mix and shake well before applying with a nail or tooth
brush twice a week.</p>

<p>I may add that I have derived some wonderful results
in treatment of Bog Spavin with the above mentioned
prescription in both young and old animals, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
it will be well to use it on both young and old
animals in both acute and chronic forms of Bog Spavin.</p>

<h2>BONE SPAVIN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sprains of the hock from falling, slipping,
jumping, pulling, traveling on uneven roads, falling
through bridges, etc.</p>

<p>Since Spavin is due to causes which come into existence
after birth, it cannot be regarded as an hereditary
disease. Hereditary predisposition, however, is largely
accountable for its appearance. In the first place, the
process of evolution in the horse, which is a single-toed
animal, descended from a five-toed ancestor, predisposes
him to suffer from union of the bones of the hock, just
as it predisposes him to splints. The weaker the bones
of the hock in comparison to the weight of the body the
more inclined will the animal naturally be to contract
Spavin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Spasmodic catching up of the spavined
limb, the moment the heel of the foot touches the ground,
something after the manner of string-halt. At times the
stiffness can be observed only when the animal is pushed
from one side of the stall to the other. Spavin may
often be detected when riding a horse down a steep hill
from the fact that he drags the toe.</p>

<p>The time of all others when a spavined horse will be
apt to show his lameness will be the day following a
hard day’s work, and when he makes his first move from
the stable in the morning is the proper moment for examination.
Therefore, you should be prepared to form
judgment quickly in these cases, for the longer the
animal is trotted up and down the less lame will he
generally become.</p>

<p>We may have a visible sign of Spavin, swelling and
hardness of the part, without lameness. If there be heat
and tenderness on pressure, lameness will almost always
be present. A careful comparison should be made of
the hocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—An important factor in treating
Spavin is keeping the animal quiet. This can be accomplished
by placing the animal in a very narrow stall,
carrying his feed and drinking water for a month or six
weeks, and apply the following ointment: Red Iodide
of Mercury, two drams; Pulverized Cantharides, three
drams; Turpentine, thirty minims; Pine Tar, two
drams; lard, two ounces. Mix well and rub in well for
twenty minutes every forty-eight hours until three applications
have been applied. Repeat this treatment
again in two weeks, and grease well with lard.</p>

<p>To cure a bone spavin it is necessary to unite two or
more bones of the hock. The same thing exists in
bone spavin as in a fractured bone, only we have no
ragged edges like that of a fracture to unite; but the
animal must be kept quiet. The younger the animal
the easier the spavin is to treat, because the bones
hardened with age contain more mineral matter and less
flexible animal matter. While treating the animal, feed
food that is easily digested.</p>

<h2>BOTS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Gastrophilis</i>)</p>

<p class="center">Effect of Bots on the Health of Horses</p>

<p>Although the presence of bots inside of a horse can be
of no possible advantage to him, their presence, when
in small numbers, as a rule produce very little or no ill
effect in the horse, but if their number be large they
cannot help being a source of debility and irritation. In
practically all cases they produce indigestion, especially
among young horses, also loss of condition, colic and
even death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Bot flies lay their eggs during the autumn
months on the skin and hair of the horse. These
eggs on becoming hatched (in from 20 to 25 days) produce
small worms which irritate the skin by their movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and thus cause the horse to lick them off and to
take them into his mouth, with the result that they gain
access to various parts of the intestinal canal. The bot
having selected its place of residence, attaches itself to
the membrane lining the stomach and intestines, and
derives its sustenance during its stay from the wound
made by its hooks. In the summer the larva, after
living inside the horse for about ten months, quits its
hold and is expelled with the feces. Having concealed
itself near the surface of the ground it becomes changed
into a chrysalis from which the gadfly issues after an
inactive existence of from thirty to forty days. The
female fly becomes impregnated, lays her eggs on those
parts of the horse from which they can be most easily
licked off, and thus completes her cycle of existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Membranes about the eyes and mouth
are very pale, as though the animal had lost a large
quantity of blood; they will also be subject to colicky
attacks, hair faded, dull, rough appearance, appetite poor
and manifests a pot belly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention.</span>—The best means of prevention are
spraying your horses with the following fly repellant:
Crude Carbolic Acid, 10%; Oil of Tar, 25%; Crude Oil,
65%. Mix thoroughly. This prevents the gadfly from
depositing her eggs on the animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food for twenty-four
hours, then administer Oil of Turpentine, one ounce;
place in a gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.
Follow this in six hours with a physic consisting of Aloin,
two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in a gelatin
capsule and give with capsule gun. Repeat the above
treatment in a week or ten days to insure the expulsion
of Bots that might have escaped the first treatment.</p>

<h2>BRONCHITIS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—It may be the result of debility, constitutional
diseases, inhalation of impure air, smoke, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gases. Sometimes brought on by drenching by the
escape of liquid into the windpipe; remember, a horse
cannot breathe through his mouth. It may also be
caused by sudden chill, foreign bodies in windpipe, micro
organisms, or it may be associated with influenza, glanders,
lung fever, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Sore throat, loss of appetite, thirst, animal
appears dull, membranes of the mouth, eyes and
nose are reddened; urine is scanty and highly colored;
cough dry and husky. After two or three days the
cough becomes looser and a frothy, sticky mucus of a
yellowish color is present. This gradually becomes pus-like,
after which the animal seems somewhat relieved.
In the first stages the pulse is soft and weak, but frequently
the temperature is high, ranging from 105° F.
to 106° F.; the breathing is quick and more or less
difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the horse in a clean, comfortable,
well ventilated stall, exclude drafts, blanket if the
weather is chilly. Also, hand rub the legs and bandage
them. Inhalations from steam of hot water and Turpentine
are beneficial. Also administer Chlorate of Potassi,
two ounces; Nitrate of Potash, two ounces; Tannic Acid,
one ounce. Mix this with a pint of black-strap molasses
and give about one tablespoonful well back on the tongue
with a wooden paddle every six hours. In severe attacks
of Bronchitis it is well to apply a liniment consisting
of Turpentine, Aqua-Ammonia Fort., and raw Linseed
Oil, each four ounces; mix well and apply to the
throat and down the windpipe once or twice a day. The
animal should be fed on soft food, such as hot bran
mashes, grass, carrots, kale, apples or steamed rolled
oats. After the acute symptoms of the disease disappear,
give Pulverized Gentian Root, one ounce; Nux
Vomica, two ounces; Nitrate of Potash, three ounces;
Pulverized Fenugreek Seed, six ounces. Mix and give
one tablespoonful three times a day in the feed or in a
gelatin capsule and administer with a capsule gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h2>CAPPED KNEE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Bruises from pawing or striking objects
with the knee, falling on the ground, etc., are perhaps
the most common causes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—It may be a simple bruise, or it may be
a severe wound. There is always swelling, heat and
pain present. The joint becomes stiff and interferes
with the movement of the leg. Under careful treatment
the swelling and enlargement disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Relieve the inflammation and clean
the wound by fomenting with hot water, to which add a
few drops of Carbolic Acid. If the wound is very large,
trim off the ragged edges with a pair of scissors and apply
the following: Boracic Acid, two ounces; Iodoform,
one ounce; Tannic Acid, one ounce. Powder finely, mix
and apply two or three times a day. If the skin is not
broken, apply cold water or ice packs until the inflammation
has subsided; then use the following: Tincture
of Iodine, one ounce; Camphor, two ounces, and Gasolene,
eight ounces. Apply with nail or toothbrush every
forty-eight hours until the enlargement has disappeared.</p>

<h2>CAPPED HOCK.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Some horses have the habit of rubbing or
striking their hocks against the partition of their stalls.
May also be produced by kicks from other horses, or
hocks may be bruised by the singletree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—An enlargement at the point of the
hock, which may run up along the tendons and muscles
of the leg. Repeated injuries cause the hock to enlarge
and become flabby, and in some cases it contains a bloody
serum or pus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Do not attempt to lance the puffy
swelling on the point of the hock, as you may produce an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
open joint, which is very difficult to treat, and chances
are that you would lose the animal.</p>

<p>The treatment that I would recommend is to find out
the true cause and remove it. When the puffy swelling
is hot and painful, apply cold water or ice packs.
When the heat and pain have subsided apply the following:
Tincture of Iodine, two ounces; Gum Camphor,
two ounces, dissolved in one pint of Gasolene. Shake
the contents of the bottle before using each time and
apply with a nail or toothbrush every forty-eight hours.
This is very penetrating and will remove the enlargement
or absorb fluids that might have accumulated from the
result of the bruise.</p>

<h2>CASTRATION.</h2>

<p>There are few countries where this operation is not
performed to any great extent. Under favorable conditions
of health, castration should be performed at the
age of one year. The safest months are April and May,
and the safest time a week or two after being turned out
to pasture when he is shedding his coat. Do not operate
upon a colt that has been kept in ill ventilated place,
but have the colt in good condition, and the weather
moderate, neither too hot or too cold. See that he has
no distemper or any such disease. It is necessary that
the hands and instruments be thoroughly cleansed by
washing them in hot water, a little soap and a few drops
of cresol. If the age be above a year it is best to feed very
light the day before the operation, as there is less danger
from being thrown and tied and also from the operation
itself, when the bowels are empty. It is very important
to ascertain whether or not the colt has ever
suffered rupture, as he must be operated upon differently.
Examine the testicles to see that they are down.
Generally speaking after these precautions, so far as
the animal is concerned, he is ready for the operation.</p>

<p>There are several methods of removing the testicles
and I will mention only the Emasculator method. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is the latest method of operation, and gives results that
are satisfactory in majority of cases. In my opinion it
is the best and most humane. Open the scrotum and
allow the testicles to protrude, being careful to make the
opening sufficiently large. When the testicles protrude
sufficiently far from the opening in the scrotum, pour
some cresol and cotton-seed oil (20 drops of cresol to an
ounce of cotton-seed oil) around the cords and into the
scrotum. Apply it thoroughly in order to prevent its
healing too rapidly. Open the emasculator and place
it around the cord, shove up as far as possible on the
cord without pulling or using force. Should the patient
pull upon the cord it is better to suspend operation for
a time until he ceases, as the length of the cord cannot
be ascertained unless it is slack when the emasculator is
placed at the proper point. Tighten up the instrument
by means of pressing the two handles together until the
testicle is squeezed off. This makes a peculiarly dull cut,
different from that of a sharp knife and thus has the
effect of closing the end of the artery and preventing
the flow of blood. Some veterinarians take off both
testicles at the same time. There is, however, more danger
from bleeding in this way, and I recommend that
each be taken off separately. The patient may be allowed
to regain his feet as soon as the testicles are removed.
I desire to add again that it is absolutely necessary
to see that the hands of the operator and the instruments
are thoroughly cleansed both before and after the
operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bleeding After Castration.</span>—Frequently you will
be called on to stop bleeding after veterinaries or farmers
have used some obsolete method of castration, and I
would recommend that you use either of the following
suggestions:</p>

<p>If bleeding is from the little artery in the back portion
of the cord, it will generally stop of its own accord,
but if it should continue to bleed for 30 minutes, throw
clean, cold water against the part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>When bleeding is from the large artery in front of
the cord, it is considered dangerous. The artery should
be tied with a silk thread if possible, or twisted with a
pair of forceps. Occasionally the artery cannot be found,
in which case the hole in the scrotum should be plugged
with a clean cloth saturated with Tincture of Iron, which
will clot the blood and thus close the artery.</p>

<h2>CHOKING.</h2>

<p>This term applies to obstruction of the gullet as well
as that of the windpipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Too rapid eating, from which pieces of carrots
or other roots, or a quantity of dry food becomes
lodged in the gullet. Although obstructions of the
windpipe caused by drenching, or from food entering
the lungs, may not prove fatal for several days, an obstruction
in the gullet will kill a horse in a very short
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—No time should be lost in attempting
to remove the obstruction from the gullet. It may be
dislodged by gently manipulating the gullet. If unsuccessful
in dislodging the obstruction in this manner,
use a probang, an instrument made for this purpose,
or inject Sweet or Olive Oil into the gullet with a hypodermic
syringe, or give hypodermic injections of Arecoline.
In administering drenches with the object of dislodging
obstructions in the gullet, you must remember
that the liquids used are apt to go the wrong way, that
is to say, enter the lungs, and give rise to lung complications,
as lung fever, bronchitis, etc. Obstructions
of solid substance in the windpipe generally cause death
very shortly. When liquids enter the lungs, death is
not so apt to occur, as the animal may live several days,
and sometimes even get well. They should be treated
the same as for lung fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2>COFFIN-JOINT LAMENESS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Navicular Disease</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Driving young animals on hard roads. Always
found in the front feet, owing no doubt to the fact
the front feet support largely the weight of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The symptoms are very hard to detect.
As a rule the animal will point the affected foot when
at rest even before there is any lameness present. While
at work he apparently goes sound, but when placed in
the stable, or when stopped on hard ground, one foot
will be set out in front of the other and resting on the
toe. It will be noticed that the animal takes a few lame
steps and then goes well again. Again he may be lame
for a day, or he may leave the stable in the morning
apparently well and sound and go lame during the day.
In the course of time he will develop a severe case of
lameness, which may last for five or six days. These
spells are intermittent and finally he becomes permanently
lame, and the more he is driven the greater the
lameness, and he steps short, wears the toe of the shoe,
stumbles, falls on his knees when the road is rough.
Sometimes both front feet are affected and the shoulders
will be stiff. When put to work he sweats from pain;
there will be extreme heat about the foot, and he will
flinch from pressure.</p>

<p>Comparatively few recoveries are made from this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—First remove the shoe. If the foot is
inflamed, poultice with hot bran or flaxseed meal.
After the inflammation disappears, clean the foot well,
clip the hair from around the top of the hoof and use
the following: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulverized
Cantharides, four drams; Turpentine, thirty
drops; Lard, two ounces. Mix well and apply every
forty-eight hours, rubbing in well for twenty minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
each time. After three or four applications have been
applied, turn the animal out to pasture. Repeat this
treatment again in a month or so. Animals affected
with this disease should be put to slow and easy work
on soft ground, and carefully shod. This disease is unsatisfactorily
treated and only a few cases recover when
the best care is taken.</p>

<h2>CORNS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Dry feet, increased pressure from ill fitting
shoes, or high heeled shoes, which tend to contract the
heels and produce corns. Wide flat feet are predisposed
to bruises which terminate in corns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Lameness, or as the old saying goes,
“The animal will go tenderfooted.” When standing the
animal is generally very restless, they paw their bedding
behind them at night. Tapping or pressure on the foot
will assist in locating a corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Discover the true cause of the corn
and remove it if possible. Take away all pressure from
over the corn and turn the animal out in some damp
pasture. If this cannot be done, put on a flat “bar”
shoe, packing the sole of the foot with Pine Tar and
Oakum; then place a leather between the foot and shoe.
Repeat this application every two weeks, as this will
keep the sole soft and flexible, and with proper shoeing
your animal will be relieved of corns.</p>

<p>Frequently coffin-joint lameness or navicular disease
is mistaken for corns.</p>

<h2>CONSTIPATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Indigestible foods, irregular feeding, lack
of, or too much, exercise, insufficient secretion of digestive
materials, strictures, ruptures, paralysis, worms,
folding and twisting of the intestines, which frequently
occurs in old age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal cannot expel the contents
of the intestines, which frequently causes colicky pains.
Death from this form of constipation is generally due
to rupture of the intestines, when due to indigestible
foods or irregular feeding. Lack of, or too much, exercise
seldom produces death, although the animal may not
pass any fecal matter for a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Give a capsule containing Aloin, two
drams, and Pulverized Ginger, two drams, every eighteen
hours until the animal has a movement of the
bowels. Then give the following tonic: Pulverized Nux
Vomica, two ounces; Pulverized Gentian Root, two
ounces; Pulverized Fenugreek Seed, four ounces. Mix
well and give one tablespoonful in feed three times a
day. If the animal refuses to eat it in the feed, place one
tablespoonful in gelatin capsule and administer with
capsule gun. This will stimulate the worm-like movement
of the bowels and strengthen the heart action.</p>

<p>Give the animal all the water it will drink. If the
water is cold, take the chill off by warming or adding
warm water. If the animal will eat, feed food that is
easily digested, such as grass, carrots, turnips, potatoes
and apples, but do not feed too large a quantity at one
time. Hot bran mashes or steamed rolled oats are very
nourishing and easily digested. Rectal injections of
Soap and Turpentine in small quantities, added to warm
water, are very beneficial, and I would recommend their
use. It is advisable to elevate the animal’s hind parts
when giving rectal injections, as it will cause the animal
to retain the injection much longer, consequently it does
its intended work much better.</p>

<p>If due to worms, fast the animal for twenty-four
hours and give Barbadoes Aloes, three drams; Calomel,
one dram; Ferri Sulphate, two drams; Antimony Tartrate,
two drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give with
capsule gun. This dose should be repeated in ten days to
insure the expulsion of newly hatched worms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2>COLD.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Nasal Catarrh</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Atmospheric changes common in the spring
and fall; animal allowed to chill when standing in a draft,
or driven when the system is in a poor condition. It is
also produced by inhaling irritating gases, smoke,
drenching through the nose, dusty hay or grain that
contains infectious matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Animal is stupid, does not take food
very freely, hair stands and looks dusty, throat becomes
sore, pulse is not greatly affected. There may be a slight
rise of temperature, say 101° F. to 103° F. After a day
or two there will be a discharge of mucus from the
nostrils which may be offensive to the smell. There is
generally an increased flow of urine. The breathing is
not much affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Make the animal as comfortable as
possible by placing in a clean stall with pure air, but
avoid drafts. Blanket if the weather is chilly and give the
following prescription: Chloride of Potash, two ounces;
Nitrate of Potash, four ounces. Mix these well in a pint
of Pine Tar and place about one tablespoonful of the
mixture as far back on the tongue as possible every six
hours. Relief is very certain if this treatment is given
in the first stages. If not it will become chronic and terminate
into nasal gleet, or lung complications.</p>

<h2>COUGH.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Acute and Chronic</i>)</p>

<p>As a cough is a symptom of various diseases, these in
addition to the cough should be treated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinds of Cough.</span>—Many writers give several different
varieties, but for sake of convenience I will divide
them into two forms, namely: Acute and Chronic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Acute Coughs are generally due to sudden
exposure to cold, drafts and are the forerunning symptom
of a disease of the organs of breathing.</p>

<p>Chronic Coughs are associated with, and often a result
of, sore throat, lung fever, pleurisy, bronchitis,
broken wind, influenza, nasal gleet, catarrh, glanders,
heaves and distemper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Under each disease of which a cough
is a symptom, I have also prescribed to include its suppression.
The following prescription is reasonable in
price, yet very effective in all forms of cough: Tannic
Acid, one ounce; Potassi Chlorate, four ounces; Potassi
Nitrate, four ounces. Powder well and mix with Black
Strap Molasses, one pint; placing container in hot
water assists in dissolving contents. When this is
thoroughly mixed add Pine Tar one pint, and place
one tablespoonful well back on the tongue with a wooden
paddle every three or four hours, according to the
severity of the cough.</p>

<p>Sometimes a liniment applied to the throat and windpipe
has a good effect, and I would recommend the following
on account of its penetrating qualities: Aqua
Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Turpentine, two ounces;
Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix and apply twice
daily, shaking the contents of the bottle well before
using.</p>

<h2>COLT CONSTIPATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Improper digestion of its mother’s milk, especially
when overheated or not allowed to nurse enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The colt appears stupid; does not care
to move about, but lies flat on either side and shows
signs of great pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Give two tablespoonfuls of Cascara
Sagrada. Great care must be exercised in administering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the medicine to place it well back on the tongue; do not
hold the nose high or some of the liquid may enter the
lungs; it is much better to waste some of the medicine.
One of the most important factors in the treatment of
Colt Constipation is rectal injections; they relieve temperature,
gases, and pain, promoting the worm-like
action of the bowels and liquefying their contents.</p>

<h2>COLT DIARRHOEA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Specific infection, the action of which is favored
by insanitary conditions, irregular feeding, or permitting
the colt to nurse when the mother is overheated
or out of condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Frequent watery discharges, sometimes
tinged with blood, and as the disease progresses the colt
shows signs of great pain. If not treated promptly, the
disease will terminate fatally in the course of six or
ten days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Determine the exact cause, if possible,
and remove it. If the colt has not been weaned, attention
should at once be given the mare, and if anything
is wrong with her, it may be best to take the little
patient away from its mother and feed it on cow’s milk
sweetened with sugar. Give two tablespoonfuls of Castor
Oil on the tongue; this will remove the irritant within
the bowels. The following prescription is a very reliable
remedy: Protan, three ounces; Pulv. Ginger, four
drams; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, four grains. Mix and
make into twelve powders; give one powder on the
tongue every four hours, effecting a cure within a few
days. Do not pull the tongue, or hold the head too high.
Permit the animal to swallow slowly. Remember that
sanitary surroundings are essential in the treatment of
all diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h2>CRACKED HEELS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—There is little doubt in my mind that ammonia,
which is so plentifully found in ill-kept stables,
is the chief cause of cracked heels. The action of ammonia
on the skin renders it soft and pulpy, and diminishes
its strength by separating the layers of which it
is composed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—When inflammation is set up in the
part, the secretion of natural oil is interfered with and
cracks usually occur in the place where the skin becomes
wrinkled when the pastern joint is bent. The discharge
from cracked heels has an offensive smell. In early
stages there is extreme heat and swelling, there is pain
and lameness, which usually disappear as the case becomes
chronic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Keep the affected parts clean as possible,
if there is extreme inflammation present. Apply
hot poultice made from bran or flaxseed meal. When
the inflammation subsides, apply Zinc Ointment twice
daily. Before each application of the ointment, wash
with Warm Water and Castile Soap. Feed carrots,
green grass, if possible, also hot bran mashes or steam
rolled oats each morning. Sometimes it is well to give
a physic, and I would recommend Aloin, one and one-half
drams; Ginger, two drams. A physic has very good
effect in reducing the swelling of the legs.</p>

<h2>DENTISTRY.</h2>

<p>The art of animal dentistry has been abused by the
owners of stock allowing the services of irresponsible
men in the veterinary profession, who do not look to the
betterment of the animal’s condition. The owner of the
animals, not being able to see the condition of the animal’s
teeth for himself, is persuaded into having the animal’s
teeth worked on regardless of whether it is needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or not. The quack or transient veterinarian will pull
and crack healthy, sound teeth, and lacerate the poor animal’s
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How to Examine an Animal’s Teeth.</span>—Perhaps
the best method that can be applied in examining an
animal’s teeth or mouth is by the use of a mouth speculum.
There are several different makes on the market,
and some can be purchased very reasonably and will give
excellent service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unnatural Condition and Irritation., Etc., of
the Teeth.</span>—After studying the anatomy thoroughly
you will be able to see at once any abnormal condition of
the teeth or mouth, which are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dentition</span> begins at or soon after birth, and continues
until the horse is five years old, and the animal
suffers more or less during that time. The lower animals
do not appear to suffer so much in getting their first teeth,
but do suffer when getting their permanent ones, even
more, perhaps, than the human being. Hence, we have
dentition fever in the horse from three or four up to five
years old—there is a weak pulse, impaired appetite, a
staring coat, the bowels sometimes costive, and sometimes
there is diarrhoea; he is not able to work, and it is hard to
say what is the matter, unless the system is affected by
the irritation set up by the teeth, for all of the organs
appear to be in a healthy state. Such symptoms indicate
that the temporary teeth are not being displaced in a
proper way. The same applies to cattle. The food
passes improperly digested, which may be due to the
state of the teeth. It is well in such cases to examine the
mouth, and if you find some tooth not properly displaced,
the gums swollen, remove it—which you can sometimes
do with the thumb and finger, or you may have to use the
forceps, which we believe the best. Then give a laxative,
feed on soft food, and the animal will soon recover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irregular Teeth.</span>—The gums are sometimes irritated
in connection with the molar teeth. This irritation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
extends and affects the pharynx and larynx, and perhaps
a severe cough is the result, called a dentition cough. It
is often the result of but a slight irritation at the back
part of the gums—this cough may not be very severe, but
it is troublesome—or the gum may become badly swollen.
The best treatment is to scarify it. We find tumors in
the upper and lower jaw, perhaps from the imperfect development
of the teeth, or from slight injury, irritation,
etc. They may or may not be malignant, and are likely
to extend and involve the alveoli and bone. If not malignant,
and only upon the surface, it is called epulis, and
is not very common. If not malignant remove it, and it
may do well for some time; it will return, extend and become
a hopeless case. The horse frequently suffers from
sharp, projecting teeth, which occurs more commonly in
old horses, from wearing down the teeth in an uneven
manner. They will be sharper on the inner edge of the
lower jaw and the outer edge of the upper jaw, which
may be from faulty formation. In such cases the animal
has difficulty in eating, grinds his food, ejecting it. Perhaps
when driving him he carries the head to one side
from the bearing of the bit not being the same on both
sides. If the teeth are sharp in the lower jaw they lacerate
the tongue; if in the upper they lacerate the cheeks.
The best remedy for this is the tooth rasp, and there is no
necessity for using the mouth speculum. After rasping,
feed upon soft food for a day or two. There are
more difficult cases where the teeth project to some extent,
generally in old horses, due to malformation of the
jaw. Sometimes the upper jaw extends over the lower,
and a part of the tooth is not worn down properly, and
after a time it interferes with mastication, and the animal
suffers considerably from irritation. The same appears
in the front teeth of the upper jaw, but it is not so serious
as the back tooth. The animal may be reduced to a
walking skeleton, almost; although the appetite appears
good, the food is thrown out. You can detect by examining
with the hand, and if it is the last molar tooth it is
advisable to place a twitch on the horse’s nose, and usi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ng
the mouth speculum, then remove the projecting portion
of the tooth by means of the molar cutter. After using
the molar cutters smooth the cut surface of the tooth
with a tooth rasp and feed properly, and he will improve
rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulcerated or Caries of the Teeth.</span>—The lower
animals do not suffer from this as much as man, for two
reasons: their teeth are complicated, and the mode of living.
Sweets have a bad effect upon the teeth. Horses
rarely suffer from toothache, but they frequently suffer
from carious teeth. Caries may commence either on the
table surface, root or fang, or even in that which surrounds
the teeth; or it may result from a slight injury,
as getting a stone, etc., between the teeth when masticating,
or it may begin in the fang from improper development
of the dentine, which receives its nourishment from
the tooth-pulp, and when this is gone, the tooth does not
receive proper nourishment, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—In the early stages they are not very
plain, but become better developed after a time. The animal
will show some irritation while eating. Although he
is hungry, and goes ravenously to eating, he will all at
once quit masticating, and either holds the food in the
mouth or throws it out unchewed. This may be due to
a slight irritation of the teeth. He acts something similar
to the human being, and these symptoms may be
present for some time before well-marked symptoms
appear. But in, it may be, six months or a year, certain
distinct symptoms appear. If it is in the table surface,
the tooth is brittle and wears down more readily and the
tooth opposite to it grows longer; he quits or rejects the
food, and a peculiar stench or fetor is present. The animal
falls off in condition in most cases. When it is in
connection with the root or fang it is different. As it
extends it involves the other tissues, sets up irritation in
the upper sinus of the head, if it is in the lower jaw, as
well as the symptoms given, you will, perhaps, notice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
slight enlargement which extends down the lower portion
of the jaw; sinuses form and pus is discharged. Exercise
care and judgment and you need make no great
mistakes. I know of horses being destroyed for glanders
when only affected with ulcerated teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the tooth—and this is not
very easily done, but there are various ways. Open the
mouth by means of a mouth speculum, and, if practical,
use the forceps. The trouble with the forceps is, they are
apt to break the tooth when they are closed upon it too
tight. There is a root forcep which can be used in the lower
jaw, as the teeth in that are more easily removed than
those in the upper jaw; or you may remove by trephining,
and then, by inserting a punch, it can be driven out.
When you attempt to remove a tooth and it breaks down,
it will, in many cases, come away of itself without further
treatment. The first and second molars are more
difficult to punch out than the others. After treatment
keep the animal quiet; feed upon soft food that does not
require much mastication. There is a difference in treating
the cavity. Some recommend filling it with gutta
percha to prevent the food from passing into the sinus.
It will sometimes pass into both sinuses; but generally
there is no necessity for filling it. If you trephine, it is
more needful than in pulling. If food passes into the
sinuses then it will be necessary to fill the hole. Sometimes
in parrot-mouth the incisors of the lower jaw grow
and irritate the mucous membrane of the opposite jaw
when it is necessary to use incisor cutters or rasp them
down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolf or Supernumerary Teeth.</span>—Wolf teeth are
comparatively small in size and have only one root and
are found just in front of the upper molar teeth. Sometimes
they do harm, but that is an exception and not the
rule. They can be easily removed with a pair of small
forceps or they may be punched out in some instances,
but I prefer that you use the regular wolf tooth forcep
as it looks much better to the onlooker. I think they interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with the eyes, causing them to become watery
and inflamed, due to the tooth exerting some influence
upon the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Supernumerary Teeth.</span>—Tooth substance may
develop in almost any part of the body. These are called
supernumerary teeth and are commonly found in the
testicles, ovaries and sinuses of the head, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Body Lodged in the Mouth.</span>—A foreign
body sometimes gets lodged in the mouth, as a piece of
wood, wire from the feed, etc., and possibly becomes imbeded
between the molar teeth, and the animal is not able
to get it out. There will be difficulty in masticating; a
flow of saliva; the animal stands with the head poked out,
as if suffering from sore throat. He will partially masticate,
then try to swallow, and perhaps eject the food.
These symptoms are present in sore throat, and it is necessary
to make a careful examination; you are not likely
to mistake just one case, but if there is some other disease
prevalent that presents similar symptoms, then you
are liable to make a mistake. As stated before, exercise
care and judgment and you need make no great mistakes,
this applies to all diseases, etc., that you are called upon
to treat.</p>

<h2>CURB.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Faulty conformation of the hind legs; that
is to say, if a animal has crooked legs, a slight sprain
from slipping or jumping will produce Curb. In cases
where an animal has well proportioned limbs, and is
afflicted with Curb, it is caused by a rupture of the small
ligament or cord situated just back of the hock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A swelling will be noticed on the back
part of the hock. At first the animal is lame and the
enlargement is hot and painful. After a few days’ rest
the inflammation will partially subside and the enlargement
can be plainly seen. When the animal is walked
about he may be very lame at the start, but this will disappear
as he is moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When the curb is hot and painful, it is
well to apply ice packs or cold water to the part. When
the inflammation subsides, apply Red Iodide of Mercury,
two drams; Lard, two ounces. Mix and rub in well
for twenty minutes; repeat every forty-eight hours until
three applications are made. If the Curb is of long
standing it is more difficult to treat, in which case the
above treatment should be repeated again in two or
three months. Do not use the animal in drawing heavy
loads, or drive on slippery roads, for six months. Give
the blister time to strengthen the ruptured tendons. A
high-heeled shoe is often valuable in relieving tendons
of their tension.</p>

<h2>DIARRHOEA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sudden change of food, frozen food, soft
food, unwholesome food, stagnant water, or drinking
large quantities of water at one time, purgative medicines,
or it may be associated with blood diseases, lung
and intestinal affections, or produced by micro-organisms.
Many horses, particularly slack loined, slight,
“washy” animals, purge if worked or excited, as may be
observed among race horses when taken to a race course.
Diarrhoea may also be due to worms, or it may be merely
an effort on the part of nature to expel some irritant
matter from the bowels or from the blood, in which case
it should on no account be prematurely checked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Frequent loose evacuations of the intestines,
with or without pronounced abdominal pain; generally,
loss of appetite, animal looks gaunt and the hair
rough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Keep the animal quiet, comfortably
stabled and warmly blanketed. Give pure water to
drink, often, but in small quantities. If the animal will
eat, feed moderately on clean food, as rolled oats and
dry bran. Also, give the following prescription: Protan,
three ounces; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, ten grains;
Creosote, one dram; Powdered Ginger, two ounces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Powdered Gum Catechu, six drams; Powdered Gum
Camphor, one-half dram. Mix and make eight powders.
Place one powder in gelatin capsule and give with capsule
gun, or the same sized dose dissolved in a pint of
water and used as a drench. However, be very careful
when drenching an animal. <i>It is dangerous.</i> This prescription
will not only check the diarrhoea, but will tone
the muscular fibres of the intestines which aid in throwing
off these irritant matters from the system. If the
horse shows colicky pains, administer the same treatment
as that recommended for colic. It is well to give
the following treatment in the convalescing stages of
diarrhoea: Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces; Ferri Sulphate,
four ounces Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces;
Pulv. Fenugreek Seed, eight ounces. Mix and give one
heaping tablespoonful three times daily in feed. This
facilitates digestion by stimulating the flow of gastric
juices.</p>

<h2>DISTEMPER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Distemper is placed among the germ diseases,
and is produced by the Streptococcus of Schutz.
It is contagious and a number of animals in the same
stable may become affected at the same time. It is supposed
to attack an animal but once, but it may be contracted
a second time. May occur at any time of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal will first appear dull, and
show loss of appetite, and the hair will look dull and
rough. There will be a watery discharge from the nose,
and in a day or so a lump will appear between the jaws;
the animal keeps his head in a peculiar position; saliva
runs from its mouth; the pulse will be a little faster than
normal. The breathing will become more rapid and the
lump between the jaws will get larger. This lump, or
tumor, may form in other parts of the body, on the
shoulder, in the groin, lungs or intestines. It usually
causes death if it cannot be absorbed. This is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
irregular distemper. A determined effort should be
made to draw the lump, or tumor, to a head as soon as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the horse in a clean, well-ventilated
and lighted stall, excluding all drafts, blanket the
animal, hand rub the legs and bandage them; give inhalations
of steam from Hot Water and Turpentine. A
good method for heating water for this purpose is to
place hot stones or bricks in the water and Turpentine.
This will relieve the hard breathing. Remember a horse
cannot breathe through his mouth, therefore, liquid
drenches are dangerous. A paste made from Potassi
Chlorate, two ounces; Potassi Nitrate, two ounces, dissolved
into a pint of warm molasses and given well back
on the tongue in tablespoonful doses every two or three
hours is very beneficial. A liniment made from equal
parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort., Turpentine and Sweet
Oil should be applied every morning over the enlargement
that appears in the region of the throat. If the
enlargement fails to come to a head, use a clean knife
for lancing purposes.</p>

<p>After an attack of distemper your horse is generally
run down in condition. Give the following:
Potassi Nitrate, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four
ounces; Pulv. Anise Seed, eight ounces. Make into
thirty-two powders and give one powder three times
daily in feed.</p>

<h2>DROPSY.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Of the Belly, Chest, Sheath, Udder and Legs</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Poor circulation; kidneys not working
properly; lack of exercise; diseases of the lungs, liver,
heart, womb or sheath. Mares heavy with foal often
have dropsical swellings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Swelling seldom contains fluid, although
sometimes a sticky serum oozes through the skin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fingers pressed against the swollen parts leave impressions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Avoid giving physics in this condition
when possible, especially to mares with foal. Feed laxative
food, as hot bran mashes, green grass, carrots, potatoes,
etc.; also the following mixture: Potassi Iodide,
two ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four ounces; Chloride of
Potash, two ounces. Mix and make into sixteen powders.
Place one powder in their drinking water three times a
day. Exercise the animal as much as possible and you
will derive good results from this treatment within a
week or so.</p>

<p>I may add that in the above affection it is a bad practice
to apply hot applications, as the chances are it would
produce a sloughing of the skin.</p>

<h2>ECZEMA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Anything that interferes with the healthy
action of the skin, as checked sweating, irritation from
dirty blankets or harness, or from accumulation of dirt
on the skin through want of grooming, errors in feeding,
overheat, or by infection. In some cases the cause
seems to be constitutional; in others, local. Though the
disease is not parasitic in character, it is probable that
when once contracted the diseased parts may become
infected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Slight dryness and eruptions that may
affect the head, ears, neck, shoulders, flanks, inside of
thighs and root of the tail, followed by vesicles or pimples
which burst and discharge, or the contents may be
absorbed. The animal will rub against the stall, manger,
or any other object he can reach, until the parts are very
sore, or if worked, he will rub himself violently when
unharnessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Give Fowler’s Solution of Arsenic,
one tablespoonful morning and night on their feed; also
give a physic consisting of two drams of Aloin and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
drams of Pulverized Ginger in gelatin capsule. Give
at one dose. One physic is all that is necessary to cool out
the blood, which will assist materially in treating
Eczema. Also, apply Zinc Ointment twice daily over the
vesicles or pimples which will appear on the skin. Also,
feed easily digested food if possible, such as carrots,
apples, grass, hot bran mashes and steamed rolled oats,
and keep the animal clean and groom carefully with clean
combs and brushes.</p>

<h2>EYE DISEASES.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Inflammation of the Membrane of Nictitans</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjunctivitis</span>, or Inflammation of the superficial
structure of the eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Direct or indirect injury to the eye, as a
blow from a whip, dust, sand or chaff in the eye, or it
may be due to extreme cold, heat, or foul air.</p>

<p>The membrane of nictation is an accessory eyelid
common to all domestic animals, the purpose of which
is to remove foreign substances from the eye in much
the same manner as we use the hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Conjunctivitis and inflammation of the
membranes of nictitans are very much the same. A partial
or complete closure of the eye, and a watery discharge
due to overstimulation of the lachrymal glands,
the fluid being secreted so abundantly that it is impossible
for the tear duct to carry it away; hence, there will
be a continuous overflow of tears down the horse’s face.
The formation of a film or scum over the eye need not
cause alarm if the eye shows no sign of puncture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Examine the eye carefully and remove
any foreign body with clean cloth or feather and apply
the following: Yellow Oxide of Mercury, three grains;
Lanolin, one ounce. Mix well together and apply to the
eye three or four times daily. Avoid the use of liquid
medicines, as they are hard to apply, and the animal
throws them out by shaking the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2>FISTULOUS WITHERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Fistulous Withers are seen mostly in horses
that have a thick neck as well as those that are very
high in the withers, or among saddle horses, those that
are very low on the withers, the saddle here riding
forward and bruising the parts. They are often caused
by ill-fitting collars or saddles, by direct injury from
blows, and from the horse rolling upon rough, sharp
stones. In this location, the ulcer of the skin or a simple
abscess, if not properly and punctually treated, may
terminate into Fistula. The pus burrows and finds
lodgment deep down between the muscles, and escapes
only when the sinuses become surcharged when, during
motion of the muscles, the pus is forced to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—These of course will vary according to
the progress made by the Fistula. Following an injury
we may often notice soreness or stiffness of the front
legs, and upon careful examination of the withers we
will see small tortuous lines running from the point of
irritation downwards and backwards over the region of
the shoulder. The stiffness of the limbs may disappear
at this time, and heat and soreness of the parts may become
less noticeable, but the swelling of the shoulders
continues to enlarge. The swelling may often have the
form of a running ulcer, or its contents may dry up and
leave a tumor, which gradually develops the common
characteristic of a fistulous tumor. When the enlargement
has an opening, we should carefully examine the
pus cavity, as upon this condition will wholly depend our
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Keep the animal as quiet as possible,
as any movements of the limbs cause the pus to spread
between the lines of the muscles and form larger abscesses
or tumors. When the bone becomes diseased, it
is very difficult to effect a cure, especially where the pus
burrows back of the Scapula (Shoulder Blade). In case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the abscess is newly formed, and close to the surface,
syringing out with a solution made from Bichloride of
Mercury, five grains to one ounce of water, generally
causes the white fibrous tissue to slough away and the
parts to heal rapidly. If the abscess is deep, and the
bones become diseased, the pus will have a very offensive
odor, and I would recommend free use of a knife and
bone chisels to remove all diseased portions of bone or
muscle.</p>

<h2>FILARIAE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Thread-like Worm</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Drinking stagnant water, or eating hay
gathered from swamps or marshy land. When full
grown, the worm measures from two to six inches in
length; the tail is more or less curved. They are found
in the lung cavity, the heart sac, and the intestinal cavity,
from which they sometimes descend into the sac containing
the testicles. Animals said to have a snake in the
eye have been exhibited as curiosities; in all cases the
simulated snake was nothing more than the Filariae.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Colicky spells; poor appetite, indigestion,
pot-belly, rough coat; swelling of the sheath, legs,
and the lower surface of the belly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention is the only treatment, for
when the worms once enter the digestive canal, it is
impossible to remove them.</p>

<h2>FOUNDER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Laminitis</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Overeating or drinking—in fact, any irritation
of the stomach or intestines is liable to be followed
by Founder, owing to the similarity in the sensitive
structure of the foot, skin, and mucous membranes.
Horses with weak feet are predisposed to Founder, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it may also occur in strong-footed animals. Founder is
also produced by driving an animal on a hot summer day
and then placing in the stable where the sweat is suddenly
checked by drafts, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The horse is stiff, and moves with great
difficulty; he will generally, though not always, remain
standing. Throws weight upon the heel of the foot to
relieve the toe, and if an effort is made to back him he
will drag his feet. Excessive heat is present at the top
of the hoof, and a throbbing of the arteries may be felt.
When the fore feet only are affected, the horse will relieve
them of as much weight as possible when walking
by placing the hind feet well under the body, which
results in a peculiar jumping motion. Founder may occur
in all four feet, but the fore feet are more often
affected than the hind ones. Mares sometimes founder
after giving birth to a colt, due to inflammation of the
womb; symptoms correspond to those of common Founder.
Founder may be mistaken for disease of the lungs
or kidneys, owing to the standing position and arched
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In all cases of Founder, administer
Potassi Iodide, one ounce; Soda Bicarbonate, four
ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four ounces. Mix and give two
tablespoonfuls in drinking water every six hours. If the
animal will not take it in its water, place in gelatin capsule
and give with capsule gun.</p>

<p>Find out the true cause of the disease, if possible, and
perhaps a physic will be indicated, containing Aloin,
two drams; Ginger, two drams; place it in a capsule
and give with capsule gun. If desired results are not
obtained in eighteen hours, repeat the dose until there
is an action of the bowels. Founder following excessive
irritation of the stomach and intestines, or mares heavy
with foal, should not receive physics. Feed food that
is easily digested, as carrots, kale, apples, potatoes, hot
bran mashes, or steamed rolled oats, etc.</p>

<p>It is well to elevate the hind quarters and give rectal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
injections of Warm Water and Glycerine. Stand in
mud or water, or apply bags containing mud, bran or
ice; in fact, anything that will have a cool, moist effect
on the feet.</p>

<p>After the inflammation of the feet has subsided, and
the animal walks fairly well, you should apply a blister
containing Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Lard,
two ounces, around the top of the hoofs, and rub in well
twice forty-eight hours apart. In some cases of Founder
it is recommended to bleed the animal in the foot.
If this is attempted, good disinfectants should be used,
as lock-jaw might follow.</p>

<h2>GALLS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries from ill-fitting collars, saddles,
harness, hobbles and scalping-boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause. Never wash a Gall
with water, as this prevents its healing, nor use oils or
salves, as they accumulate dirt, dust and germs, which
may cause infection. The following application makes
a very valuable dressing for Galls: Boracic Acid, one
ounce; Corn Starch, one ounce; Tannic Acid, one-half
ounce; Iodoform, one dram. Powder finely and place in
sifter-top can. Dust on Gall before going to work and
on retiring. This heals and refreshes the Galls and
wounds by forming a smooth surface over the part, which
permits it to heal while the horse works.</p>

<h2>GREASE HEEL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Parasitic fungi invading cracked heels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Offensive discharge from the glands
under the skin, and if not properly treated, red spots will
appear, and the yellow discharge will form a hard crust
sticking to the roots of the hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Cleanliness is one of the most important
measures. Also, good nourishing food. If the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
is swollen and tender, poultice with hot Flaxseed Meal or
bran. After the swelling and tenderness have abated,
wash well with good Castile Soap and Warm Water.
Dry with clean cloth and apply the following mixture:
Calomel, one dram; Iodoform, one dram; Boracic Acid,
one ounce. Mix well and apply two to three times a day.
Feed green grass, carrots, kale, apples, or potatoes if
possible, also feed hot bran mashes. In all cases of
Grease Heel give the following physic: Aloin, two
drams; Pulv. Ginger, two drams. Place in a capsule and
give with capsule gun. A physic has a very good effect
on the blood, which assists materially in healing the
cracks and nodules that appear in Grease Heel.</p>

<h2>GLANDERS OR FARCY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a specific germ called the Bacillus
Malleii, or Bacillus of Glanders. Glanders, or Farcy, is
very contagious, and is transmissible to man as well as
animals. Cattle and sheep alone are immune. The disease
may be contracted at watering troughs, stables,
horseshoeing shops, in boats, trains and by harness, bits,
curry combs, bedding, pails, etc., as well as by direct contact
with a diseased animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Animal does not thrive although the
appetite is good at times; loss of flesh, and is subject to
sweats, the hair looks rough, the temperature increasing
slightly, perhaps two degrees, a cough is generally
present. Legs and abdomen are swollen; discharge
from the nose, sometimes tinged with blood and very
sticky, the membranes of the nose look dusty, and ulcers
or spots are visible if closely examined. The glands
under the back of the ears and between the jaws are
hard, lumpy and swollen.</p>

<p>In addition to the above symptoms, Farcy affects the
skin by producing swellings, or nodules, varying from
the size of a pea to that of a hickory nut (called Farcy
buds, or Farcy buttons), which are found inside of the
hind legs under the abdomen, on the side of the chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
shoulder and neck, also around the nose, lips and face.
Generally there is a discharge of greenish-yellow pus,
which is very sticky.</p>

<p>Glanders, or Farcy, may be mistaken for nasal catarrh,
nasal gleet, ulcerated teeth, nettle rash, lymphangitis,
distemper, etc. Fortunately, this dreaded disease
is not very prevalent in this country, as every precaution
has been taken to stamp it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Treatment.</span>—If at any time you have reason to
think one of your animals has the disease, or even a
neighbor’s, or a transient horse, exhibits the symptoms,
it is your duty to report the fact to the State Veterinarian
at once. You will do this if you have your own
welfare and that of your neighborhood at heart.</p>

<h2>HEAVES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Emphysema of the Lungs</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Fast or heavy work. It may follow Lung
Fever or Pleurisy, or the animal may inherit weakness
in the walls of the air-cells of the lungs. A very common
cause is feeding dusty or dirty hay, or bulky food.
Horses that are accustomed to eating ravenously are
often victims of Heaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Disease may develop slowly or rapidly.
When the animal is at rest, the air is taken into the lungs
in a more or less normal manner, but is expelled by two
distinct efforts, the abdominal muscles aiding the lungs
in expiration, as may be seen by the heaving of the
flank; the movement of the ribs in breathing is scarcely
noticeable in a heavy horse. A healthy animal, when at
rest, will throw the air from the lungs in a single effort.
The difficulty in breathing is constant and increases in
proportion to the amount of food in the stomach and
intestines. At the beginning of the attack there is a
spasmodic cough, which is more or less intermittent;
this develops later into a short, weak, suppressed cough,
as if the animal lacked strength in his chest to expel a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
full breath, often accompanied by expulsion of wind
from the anus, which is somewhat protruded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Feed good, nourishing food, but nothing
that is of a bulky nature. Feed more grain and less
hay, which should be dampened with water if dusty. Do
not feed dusty, musty or bulky food, but give plenty of
potatoes, apples, kale and green grass. Have your druggist
make up one quart of Fowler’s Solution of
Arsenic, omitting the Tincture of Lavender. This is
soothing to the organs of breathing, and should be given
two tablespoonfuls three times a day on the feed. After
a week or ten days you might increase the dose slightly.
Although this will make the horse work much better, do
not give it with the hope of effecting a complete cure,
as very few cases recover fully from this disease.</p>

<h2>INFLUENZA.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Pink Eye—Epizootic Catarrh</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Influenza is a specific and infectious fever,
which shows a marked tendency to spread rapidly over a
large area of country. It generally appears suddenly,
without preliminary symptoms, and may become fully
developed in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The usual symptoms are those of Catarrh,
although the bowels, lungs and brain complications
may be present, either singly or combined. It
always gives rise to great weakness. The distinguishing
characteristics of Influenza from Distemper, Sore
Throat, and other diseases affecting the organs of
breathing, are the suddenness of the attack, rise of temperature,
varying from 103° to 106° F., pulse feeble
and fast, and a pinkish, swollen appearance of the inside
of the eyelids. The animal is dull, in some cases
almost unconscious. Sometimes the legs are very stiff
and swollen, and there is great difficulty in moving
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the affected animal in a clea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>n,
well ventilated stall, avoid drafts, give pure water to
drink with chill taken off, in small quantities but often.
Blanket if the weather is chilly, hand rub the legs and
bandage, give Quinine, two drams, in a gelatin capsule
with capsule gun every four hours. In addition to the
above, administer the treatment recommended for Acute
and Chronic Coughs.</p>

<p>Feed good, nutritious food that has a laxative effect
on the bowels, as it is dangerous to give horses physic
with this disease. Hot bran mashes, steamed rolled oats
and vegetables are very beneficial.</p>

<h2>LAMPAS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—In young horses it is commonly caused by
cutting teeth. In older animals it is usually due to indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A puffy swelling and redness of the
gums. The animal may have difficulty in eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In young animals, when cutting teeth,
let nature take its course, but when an animal is five
years or over, place two drams of Aloin, and two drams
of Pulv. Ginger, in a gelatin capsule and administer with
capsule gun. Then tone up the digestive organs by mixing
one ounce of Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce of Pulv.
Nux Vomica, four ounces of Bicarbonate of Soda. Make
into eight powders and give one powder in feed twice
daily, or place in gelatin capsule and administer with
capsule gun.</p>

<h2>LEECHES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Haemopis</i>)</p>

<p>The leeches which suck the blood of the horse may be
divided into two classes, the external parasites which
attach themselves to the skin of the legs and adjacent
parts of the horse, and the Haemopis Sanguisuga, and
others of this class, which, not being able to penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the skin, endeavor to enter the mouth or nostrils of the
horse when he is drinking or grazing in wet and leech-infected
pastures. They sometimes cling to the mucous
membrane of the eyes. The horse leech, which lives in
the water, usually gains access to the mouth and nostrils
of the animal, when young and not more than one-tenth
of an inch long. They rarely go beyond the air and food
passages, generally fastening themselves to the walls of
the windpipe and gullet, where they cling till the animal
dies from loss of blood or suffocation. They often cause
bleeding from the mouth and nostrils, and may be seen
by close examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Endeavor to build up the condition of
the animal with suitable food. Also feed liberal quantities
of rock salt. Where the leeches cling tightly to
the mucous membranes of the mouth and nostrils, it is
well to cause the horse to inhale the vapor from hot
water containing turpentine.</p>

<h2>LOCK-JAW.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Tetanus</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The bacilli of Tetanus are widely distributed
and can be found in practically every part of the
globe. Their favorite place of production, however, is in
barn yards and marshy ground. They are frequently
swallowed by stock along with forage, and can often be
found in recently expelled feces. The most favorable temperature
for their development is about 70° F. They act
by means of extremely virulent poisons which they produce,
and which causes the terrible symptoms that are
characteristic of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The muscles of expression are usually
the first brought under the continual spasm of tetanus,
and when thus affected give the face of the animal a
pinched and drawn-in appearance. The other muscles
of the head and those of the neck are next attacked. The
mouth is closed, the nose poked out, the head elevated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The muscles of breathing, and those of the limbs, become
contracted so that the neck is hollowed, and the
tail is raised, the horse stands with outstretched limbs.
The animal shows great stiffness or rigidity in attempted
movements. The eyes are sunken, and when startled
or excited, the breathing is quickened and the flanks
have a wrinkled or corrugated appearance. Death may
quickly occur from continuous spasms of the muscles of
the throat. Another sign is the flying up of the accessory
eyelid when the animal is excited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Almost every medicine in the pharmacopoeia
has been tried in the treatment of tetanus,
certain remedies meeting with great success in the
hands of some practitioners, and proving total failures
in the hands of others. It is, however, generally
admitted by the members of the profession
that perfect quietness is of greatest importance in
the treatment of tetanus. Place the patient in a dry,
well ventilated, loose box stall, slightly darkened, if possible,
in an out-of-the-way place, and fill the ears with
cotton-wool. Administer a full dose of purgative medicine
(aloes eight drams) and follow with belladonna in
a capsule or bolus. The body should be lightly clothed,
and the animal placed in slings. Never give drench if it
produces excitement. When the wound can be discovered,
powerful antiseptics should be continually applied
to its lowest depths. Arsenious acid, chloroform, hyoscyamus,
digitalis, belladonna, chloral hydrate, morphine,
potassium bromide, carbolic acid, and many other medicines
have been used, and some of them have been found
beneficial. Belladonna is probably as good as any, and
should be given freely. Inhalations of chloroform temporarily
abate spasm, but the reaction afterwards is
usually severe. Medicines which can be given in the
drinking-water may be administered in that way. The
food should consist of milk, eggs, beef-tea, wine gruel,
and food of that description, easily taken and of a very
nutritious character. Too great care or attention cannot
possibly be bestowed upon the animal. The after-treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
consists of allowing a liberal quantity of good nutritious
food—green food is preferable. Exercise daily
for some time after recovery has taken place, and the
work should be light and slow for a month or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preventive Treatment.</span>—An antitoxin serum, if
injected under the skin of a patient before a surgical
operation, or immediately after the infection of a wound,
is a most reliable safeguard against tetanus. It should
always be used in districts where tetanus is prevalent.
Its value subcutaneously is solely preventive, not curative;
and it is of no use when once the disease has gained
a foothold.</p>

<h2>LUNG FEVER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Pneumonia</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Predisposition is largely accountable for
this disease, which is more common to young horses than
old; also, changes of temperature, introduction of foreign
bodies or liquids into the trachea (windpipe) and
the bronchial tubes, inhalation of smoke or irritating
gases, excitement, exposure to cold after clipping, turning
out to pasture from a warm stable, or injury to chest
or ribs from being struck with a pole, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Dullness in spirit; animal usually shivers
or trembles; when this ceases the temperature rises to
perhaps 103° to 106° F., pulse increases to sixty or
ninety per minute, full and bounding; breathing short
and labored and abnormally quick, increasing to perhaps
fifty inspirations per minute, whereas in health it
does not exceed twelve or thirteen per minute. A cough
is also likely to be present, and the animals remain standing
until they are on the road to recovery, or until death
takes place. Other symptoms are constipation, feces
covered with mucus or slime; urination frequent, scanty
and dark in color; appetite poor, but thirst great; the
eyes look glassy and the membranes have an inflamed
appearance. It is a good sign if the animal looks about
freely. When the critical stage is past the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and pulse gradually fall, the appetite returns and the
urine becomes more abundant, and takes on its natural
color, the cough loosens, and the discharge from the
lungs is profuse, and of a yellowish color, and the
breathing becomes normal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Good care is of the utmost importance.
Place the horse in a comfortable, well ventilated
stall, being careful to exclude drafts. Hand rub and
bandage the legs with woolen cloth. Blanket the animal,
give plenty of bedding and keep pure water before him
at all times. Internally administer Quinine, two ounces;
Iodide of Ammonia, two ounces; Ammonia Bicarbonate,
two ounces. Mix well and make into sixteen powders.
Place powder in gelatin capsule, and give with capsule
gun every four hours. It is quite necessary that the
above remedy should be placed in capsule, as drugs of
this nature tend to irritate the throat. Do not give
physics, as it is much safer to give laxative food, as hot
bran mashes, steam rolled oats or some vegetables, in
fact anything the animal will eat, i. e., that has food
values. It is advisable to apply over the chest the following
liniment: Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces;
Turpentine, four ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces.
Mix and shake well before applying each time over the
chest cavity.</p>

<p>In case the animal is constipated, give rectal injections
of soap and warm water containing a few drops of
Turpentine.</p>

<h2>MANGE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Scabies</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Mange is a contagious disease, produced by
the presence of a small parasite that varies in length
from a fiftieth to a hundredth of an inch, according to
the species, of which there are three: Sarcoptes, which
generally affects the withers; Symbiotes Communis, affecting
the legs, and the Psoroptes Communis, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
affects horses about the root of the tail and mane. The
latter is one most commonly found affecting horses.
They multiply rapidly and are spread from diseased to
healthy horses by their bodies coming in contact with
one another, or by corrals, stables, railroad cars, etc.,
recently occupied by mangy horses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The mange mite attacks the skin and
produces a thickness of its outer surface, covering it with
crusts and scabs, with a consequent loss of hair. Intense
itching accompanies the disease, and affected horses
continually bite and rub themselves.</p>

<p>Psoroptic Mange commences at the root of the tail,
or at the roots of the mane on the neck or withers, and
gradually spreads over the back, up to the head, over
the sides, and finally affects the entire body. In cases of
long standing the skin becomes ulcerated, the animal becomes
greatly weakened, emaciated and finally dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When a large number of horses are
affected (in one locality) it is best to prepare a vat and
dip them, under the supervision of the United States
Bureau of Animal Industry. When just a few horses
become affected, the following has proven very effective:
Sulphur, eight ounces; Oil of Tar, eight ounces; Sweet
Oil, two quarts. Mix and apply liberally to the parts
affected. A few applications are generally sufficient to
eradicate the disease.</p>

<h2>LYMPHANGITIS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This ailment is common with hard working
horses, and is caused by confining them in the stable and
allowing their usual amount of food. More nutriment is
consumed than can be taken up by the system, which
causes an irritation. It is frequently found in certain
stables on Monday morning, hence its name—Monday
Morning Disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Swelling and lameness, most usually
affecting the hind leg instead of the thigh and extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
down the leg in a hard ridge. It will pit on pressure,
and cause intense pain; the horse will have difficulty in
extending the limb forward, the swelling may surround
the leg entirely. Pulse will be fifty to sixty per minute,
temperature 102° to 104° F., breathing will be faster
than normal. The animal has great thirst, but the appetite
is very poor; usually remains standing; if he lies
down will have great difficulty in getting up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In this particular disease apply hot
fomentations to the affected limb or limbs, for one hour,
then rub dry and apply Camphorated Liniment. Give
Nitrate Potassi, Chlorate of Potassi, Iodide Potassi,
each four ounces. Mix and make into thirty-two powders.
Give one powder three times a day in drinking
water or in a gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.</p>

<p>In most cases it is advisable to give a physic: Aloin,
two drams; Pulv. Gentian Root, one dram; Ginger, one
dram. Place in gelatin capsule and give with capsule
gun.</p>

<h2>MUD FEVER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Horses driven over muddy roads during the
day and exposed to freezing weather at night, or driving
them over muddy roads, then washing the limbs and not
drying them properly, often produces a superficial inflammation
of the legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The legs are swollen, extremely hot and
tender, the horse is stiff, the hair comes off the legs easily
and if the cause is not removed severe complications may
follow, as the secretions of the skin become greatly affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention. Horses that are driven
over muddy, wet roads should have their legs rubbed dry
when stabling them for any length of time. When the
legs are badly swollen wash them with clean warm water
and castile soap and dry them well with a clean soft cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Then apply Zinc Oxide Ointment or a lotion made from
Acetate of Lead, one ounce; Zinc Sulphate, one-half
ounce. Place in a quart of clean water and apply twice
daily. Either application is very beneficial in the treatment
of Mud Fever. Feed the animal wheat bran mashes,
steamed rolled oats, vegetables, etc., as they have a very
good effect on the system which aids in relieving the inflammation
of the skin.</p>

<h2>NASAL GLEET.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Chronic Catarrh</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to cold followed by neglect, and
lack of nourishing food; bruise or fracture of the frontal
bones of the head; injury of the blood-vessels inside the
bones, or an ulcerated tooth. May also be caused by
tumor, or foreign substance or liquids in the nasal cavities.
Sometimes dried pus in the nostrils, resulting from
a cold, will cause nasal gleet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A white or yellowish discharge from
one or both of the nostrils, the quantity varying with the
severity of the attack and the length of time the disease
has been established. If, when tapping over the nose
below the eye, a dull sound is produced, it is safe to conclude
that the cavities are filled with pus; to make certain,
compare the sick animal with a healthy one; in some
cases you will notice that even the bones of the nose below
the eye are slightly elevated. The lining of the nose may
be of a red or yellow color but not ulcerated in spots, as
in Glanders. The animal may continue in good
spirits and work well for a time but as the case develops
he becomes lean in flesh and what is termed hide-bound.
Always examine the teeth. In a case of long standing,
the discharge has a fetid smell, differing in this respect
also from Glanders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If not due to fractured bones of the
head or ulcerated teeth, the animal will, in most cases,
recover with proper medical treatment. When due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
injury to the bones of the head, tumors, ulcerated teeth
or dried pus in the nasal cavities, it is best to remove the
diseased portion with the aid of bone chisel or tephine
and treat the wound antiseptically. In the mild forms of
nasal-gleet or chronic catarrh, administer the following:
Ferri Sulphate, Potassi Iodide, Nux Vomica, each four
ounces. Mix well and make into thirty-two capsules.
Give one capsule three times daily and feed food that is
nourishing and easily digested.</p>

<h2>NAVEL STRING INFECTION.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Umbilical Pyemia</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause and Nature.</span>—While the unborn foal
(foetus) is in the womb of its mother, it is surrounded
by enveloping membranes which constitute the afterbirth
on delivery. These membranes are attached to the
wall of the womb and are connected to the foetus by
means of the navel-string (umbilical cord) which is provided
with two arteries and a vein for the nourishment
of the young creature and for the removal of its waste
products.</p>

<p>It also has a narrow canal (the urachus) which serves
to remove the urine of the foetus; in fact the subsequently
formed bladder takes its origin from a dilation of the
urachus. Under normal conditions when the foal is born,
respiration takes place, the umbilical arteries and veins
become quickly blocked up, urine is discharged through
the urethra (which communicates with the penis or vagina,
as the case may be), the foal enjoys a separate
existence and the wound caused by the division of the
umbilical cord leaves a scar which is known as the navel.</p>

<p>It is usually supposed that the germ of navel-string
infection gains admittance into the body through the exposed
surface before the wound is closed. However, I
am of the opinion that the mother is the bearer of the
infection in a great many cases for in the uterine secretions
of mares whose foals fell with navel-string infection,
the same characteristic germs were found as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
present in the joints of the affected foals. The infectious
material is, by the act of covering, conveyed from
mare to mare, so that the mucous membranes of the
womb becomes the habitat of the specific germ. By inoculation
of these germs into the blood stream of foals
an illness is produced which in the smallest particular
cannot be distinguished from that arising in naturally affected
foals. It is a strange fact that when the infected
germs are transmitted by the mother, their presence does
not produce any disturbance in her.</p>

<p>This is a very common malady in most places. I have
known several instances on particular farms where they
were unable to raise either foals or calves, but if the
mother were removed to another farm immediately after
or before foaling, the foal or calf lived and was reared
without difficulty, and although constitutional debility
plays an important part, the presence of specific germs
constituting an infected area is, I believe, the most important
factor in producing this disease.</p>

<p>According to my observation, about seventy-five per
cent of the cases die within the first three weeks after
birth. This high rate of mortality would be considerably
diminished if proper treatment was adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The attack usually comes on during the
second or third week after birth and almost always before
the closure of the navel opening, which, in affected
animals, will be found to be in a wet and suppurating
condition. Occasionally foals two or three months old
which have the urachus closed and are in an apparently
healthy condition contract this disease in a form of painful
swelling of the joints. The first symptoms are generally
dullness; more or less fever; lameness which is
often attributed to rheumatism or to injury caused by
the mare treading on foal; the disinclination to move
or even to stand. Upon examination the patient will be
found to have a soft, gelatinous swelling of one or more
of the joints of which the hock, elbow, fetlock, stifle and
hip usually manifest the enlargement most clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>These swellings are hot and painful to the touch; they
tend to suppurate and frequently cause intense lameness.
In very rare cases open urachus may exist without any
joint inflammation. In this disease, inflammation of the
joints and open urachus are almost always co-existent.</p>

<p>Animals that recover from a bad attack are seldom
worth the trouble of rearing, because as a rule their constitution
becomes permanently impaired and one or more
of their joints becomes stiffened by the attack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In the treatment of this disease, we
have to attend to constitutional disturbances, inflamed
joints, open urachus and complications such as constipation
and diarrhoea. The comfort of our little patient
must be studied under all circumstances. If the weather
be at all cold it should be covered by a warm sheet.
Should the foal have any difficulty in rising from the recumbent
position, an attendant should assist it to rise
and see that it is regularly fed. It is only in extreme
cases that the animal refuses to suck its dam. During
warm weather, and especially if the ground is dry, such
a patient is always better off for a little sunshine, but on
no account must it be left out during extreme heat, as in
this state it is very liable to sunstroke. The best food for
the mare is grass, which during the day, she can generally
have. The inflamed joints of the foal should be rubbed
lightly with the following, after being thoroughly mixed:
Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Vaseline, two
ounces, every forty-eight hours, which, when applied to
the skin, appears to have a well-marked antiseptic action
on the underlying tissues. An inflamed joint should on
no account be bathed with warm water, fomented or
poulticed because the application of moist heat would be
the best possible means for promoting the development
of the infective germs which are the cause of the local
and general disturbance. The open navel-string should
not be ligatured because that operation is generally followed
by an increased inflammation of the part, and by
an aggravation of the other symptoms apparently on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
account of this outlet for deleterious products becoming
blocked up. If the navel-string has been ligatured and
is in an inflamed state, the ligature should be removed
without delay. If the foal is constipated give two or
three ounces of Castor Oil; also, administer the following:
Zinc Sulphocarbolates, one-half dram; Hyposulphite
of Soda, four ounces. Mix and make into thirty-two
powders. Give one powder well back on the tongue
every four hours.</p>

<p>As a supplement to the food, we may give brown
sugar or treacle, both of which are easily digested and
are very nourishing. Four or five eggs daily will also
aid in keeping up the strength.</p>

<h2>NAVEL RUPTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Umbilical Hernia</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hereditary predisposition is well marked in
this complaint. It may exist at birth, but so-called congenital
rupture may very probably be the result of the
pulling which the navel-string underwent at the time of
foaling. However, umbilical hernia usually occurs during
the first two or three months after birth; that is to say,
while the opening at the navel is becoming obliterated
and the tissues at that place are becoming consolidated.
They can, however, appear later and may result from
more or less violent strains sustained when the foals are
jumping or playing. At other times these strains are
induced by intestinal irritation accompanied by diarrhoea
or constipation with straining. But, however the strain
may take place, the abdominal muscles contract and push
the intestines towards the wall of the belly. Then if they
find an opening or even a weak spot, like the ring of the
navel while it is undergoing the process of becoming
blocked up, they select it and a rupture is produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—This rupture, the situation of which
clearly shows its character, may vary in size from that
of a hen’s egg to that of an ostrich’s egg. If pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ssed
upon with the hand, especially if the animal is placed on
its back, the rupture will disappear, to return, however,
when the pressure is removed. If it be composed of intestines
it will be soft and elastic when the bowels are
empty, but when they are full of semi-solid food they
will be doughy. In any event, the tumor will feel elastic
when composed of intestines, but when formed of its connecting
membranes, will naturally not vary in consistence.
If intestines be present, movements and abdominal
rumblings may be detected in it. This rupture
rarely gives rise to serious consequences because its contents
are composed of large intestines and omentum,
either of which is, in this position, not liable to become
strangulated. It may, however, become engorged and
inflamed from injury. Its existence naturally depreciates
the value of an animal suffering from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In the majority of cases, they will disappear
of their own accord in two or three months. In
case the rupture shows no signs of diminishing in size it
is well to apply a bandage around the abdomen.</p>

<h2>OPEN JOINT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries such as a kick from a sharp shoe,
wire cuts, punctures from snags, or from probing a
wound near a joint. Open joint is one of the most serious
accidents that may happen to a horse, for the sufferer
is apt to die from the ensuing constitutional disturbance,
and even if he recovers the joint will, in all probability, be
permanently stiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—If the joint is opened or severely injured
the wound will have an ordinary appearance except
that there may be a flow of joint oil from the injured
oil sack. However, the discharge gradually becomes
more unhealthy until finally it is mixed with pus
and blood and assumes a fetid odor. After two or three
days the joint swells and becomes very painful and a high
fever sets in. In unfavorable cases the animal dies from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
exhaustion very shortly, or at best recovers with a permanently
stiff joint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Never probe a wound near a joint. If
the injury is small and noticed immediately, apply Red
Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Vaseline, two ounces.
Mix and rub in well over the wound. This will set up
sufficient inflammation to close the opening and kill any
infection that may be present, as it possesses powerful
antiseptic properties. If the wound is large, wash with
Bichloride of Mercury, one part to one thousand parts
distilled water. The wound should be washed twice a
day with this solution. Then dust the wound with Tannic
Acid, one ounce; Iodoform, one ounce; Boracic Acid, one
ounce; Calomel, one dram. Mix and place in sifter top
can and apply this after washing each time. Then bandage
the wound by first placing clean absorbent cotton
over the wound. Do not attempt to syringe a solution
into an opening or some of the solution may gain entrance
into the joint. Keep the animal as quiet as possible
and feed laxative food.</p>

<h2>PALESADE WORM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Strongulus Armatus</i>)</p>

<p>This parasite thrives on marshy ground and is commonly
found in the United States and Canada. The
body of the worm is gray in color, more or less stiff and
straight and thicker in the front than in the hind part;
it varies in length, the male measuring from three-fourths
of an inch to one inch and the female from one to
two inches. It may occur in an adult or an immature
state. In the former it implants itself on the mucous
membrane of the large intestines by means of its armed
mouth, while in the latter it lives in cysts underneath the
mucous membrane of the intestines and is sometimes
found in the brain, testicles and liver. The immature
worms which do not issue directly from the cysts get into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the arteries and are carried by the force of the blood to
all parts of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Same as in Red Worm with the exception
of colicky pains caused by the worms blocking the
arteries which carry blood to the intestines, thus interfering
with the process of digestion. Where the worms
enter the arteries of the limbs it results in lameness. It
is a good plan to examine animals once or twice a year
to insure them against this pest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Same as for Red Worm.</p>

<h2>PLEURISY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to sudden changes of temperature,
confinement in ill-ventilated, damp stables, wounds
penetrating the chest, fractured ribs, heart diseases. It
also occurs in conjunction with Bronchitis, Influenza,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Generally only one side of the lungs is
affected and that being the right, although it may affect
both sides at the same time. First you will notice the
animal distressed, uneasy, shivering, the affected side is
painful to pressure of the hand. The breathing is short
and quick, and the flanks heave—which shows that the
animal tries to breathe as much as possible, by the action
of the muscles of the abdomen and not by the movement
of the ribs. The nostrils are dilated. There is usually
a short, dry, painful cough present, which is repressed
by the animal as much as possible, so as not to shake the
inflamed parts. Often when expelling air from the lungs
the horse gives a painful grunt especially when made to
move. The pulse is generally hard and faster than
usual. The temperature in early stages may rise from
104° to 106° F. If the ear is applied to the affected side
a dry crackling or friction sound can be heard; a groove
along the lower portion of the ribs will extend back to
the flank. Within two or three days the pulse will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
softer and weaker, temperature will fall to 101° or 102°
F. and there will be fluids form and the painful short
breathing will disappear. The liquids may now undergo
absorption if properly treated, and the case terminate
favorably in a week or ten days.</p>

<p>Frequently large quantities of fluid accumulate in
the chest cavity that cannot be absorbed, the breathing
becomes more difficult, short and quick, pulse becomes
weak and rapid and the animal dies from exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the animal in a comfortable,
roomy stall; blanket if the weather is chilly, permit fresh
air, but no drafts, as this is very important. Apply a
paste made from Mustard and cold water over the chest
cavity. Internally, administer Ammonium Iodide, Chlorate
of Potash, Nitrate of Potash, each four ounces.
Make into thirty-two powders and give one powder every
two or three hours in gelatin capsule and administer with
capsule gun. The diet is a proper means of keeping up
the animal and is very important. Coax the animal to
eat grass or vegetables, hot bran mashes or steam rolled
oats. If there is a cough present, give the same treatment
as recommended for Acute and Chronic Coughs.</p>

<h2>PIN WORM, THREAD OR MAW WORM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Oxyuris Curvilis</i>)</p>

<p>This worm when full grown is about one and three-quarter
inches in length; its tail is thin and whip-like
and head thick and terminating in a curve somewhat resembling
the crook of a stick. The presence of these
parasites may be detected by a light-yellow substance
(the eggs of the worms) which adheres to the skin below
the anus. Pin Worms like Round Worms frequently
come away with the feces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Dissolve four tablespoonfuls Common
Salt in one gallon of warm water and inject it into the
rectum. When this has been expelled, follow with an injection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
per rectum of Turpentine, four ounces, to one-half
gallon Linseed Oil. Elevate the horse’s hind quarters
so as to retain the injection longer. This will expel
the worms and their eggs that cling to the walls of the
rectum. The worms sometimes make their way so far
forward that it is impossible to reach them with an injection.
In this case treat same as for Round worms.</p>

<p>Where there is irritation produced about the tail the
horse continually rubs and it is well to apply Mercurial
Ointment to both tail and the anus.</p>

<h2>POLL EVIL.</h2>

<p>Poll Evil is so-called because it occurs in the region of
the poll. It is not a constitutional disease, but comes,
no doubt, from well marked causes, as from inflammation
set up and involving the bones and muscles in the
region of the poll, and perhaps of the larger ligament.
Owing to the low vitality of the parts and the action of
the head in taking food, etc., the pus is apt to burrow
deep into the muscle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Direct or indirect injury. A common cause
is striking the head against a low doorway or an ill-fitting
halter or bridle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Swelling just back of the ears on one
or both sides of the head. The animal stands with the
nose out; slight heat in the parts, pain on pressure. In
the first stages, it is merely inflammatory action. The
second stage is suppuration, or there may be great swelling
in some cases when there is but little pus formed.</p>

<p>In other cases there is profuse suppuration and the
pus makes its way out and discharges to the surface and
sinuses are formed, which extend in various directions.
Any abscess in this region is called Poll Evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When the enlargement is first noticed
in the region of the poll, I would advise the following:
Red Iodide of Mercury, four drams; Lard, four ounces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
rub in well over the enlargement and perhaps this will
prevent sinuses from forming, but when the cases are
long standing and so-called pipes are formed, I would
advise removing all diseased material and treat as an
ordinary wound.</p>

<h2>PETECHIAL FEVER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Purpura Haemorrhagica</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Constitutional weakness following some debilitating
disease such as Distemper, Pink Eye, Catarrh
and even following operations, when an animal becomes
weak from want of exercise, in which case it generally
appears during his recovery. It is not infectious
and cannot be transmitted by inoculations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—There is a slight swelling of the limbs,
most likely to be about the hocks. The swelling may
disappear by exercising, but will soon return. The swellings
present a very abrupt appearance, nearly the same
as if a string were tied around the limbs and swell very
quickly, and symptomatic of Purpura. Exudations take
place in which, if on white limbs, you will see little red
spots, from which a liquid is oozing. The swelling is
very painful and the entire limb may be swollen. Small
vesicles appear on the limbs and also in the mucous membranes,
and it is well to look at the mucous membranes
before giving your opinion, as you will, no doubt, detect
these spots, which may extend into the lungs. These
spots increase and may run into each other. The mucous
membranes of the nose may become a mass of corrupt
matter. The upper lip may hang pendulous, which is
due to the want of nervous stimulus. If the nostrils are
swollen very badly, there is difficulty in breathing and if
the animal is not able to take food, the symptoms are considered
very bad. The pulse varies much in some cases;
although the swelling is very great, the pulse may not be
more than forty or fifty per minute. The temperature is
elevated one to three degrees above normal, there may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be a cough and a brownish colored discharge from the
nostrils. The mouth and eyes become affected and, together
with the discharge from the nose, the horse is a
loathsome looking object. In milder cases the appetite
is retained, or the animal may take food one day and the
next refuse it. The bowels are constipated as a general
rule in the first stages of the disease and the urine may
be of a dark color, may even contain blood. There may
be a peculiar dropsical swelling of these petechial spots
or it may show itself in connection with the eyes and
there may be blood extravasation without outer symptoms.
This disease may effect the bowels, liver, lungs,
etc. The animal usually stands, perhaps from the difficulty
in moving the limbs. It is necessary to watch the
case closely, for flies will attack him and he will be filled
with maggots. Sloughing may take place; the entire
sheath or patches upon the body may slough off and there
may be paralysis of the penis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the animal in a clean, light,
comfortable stall. If the weather is cold, blanket. The
following medicine is recommended because of its particular
effect on the blood in this disease: Chlorate of
Potash, eight ounces; Iodide of Potash, eight ounces;
Quinine Sulphate, eight ounces. Make into thirty-two
capsules and give one capsule every six hours. Also administer
one ounce capsules filled with Spirits of Turpentine
three or four times a day. Moisten the capsules
with Sweet Oil and give with capsule gun. Feed hot
bran mashes containing two or three ounces of pure
Flaxseed meal. Also, feed vegetables, green grass, if
possible.</p>

<h2>QUITTOR.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Fistula of the Foot</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries. Horses working on rough stony
roads are subject to punctures, pricks, bruises, corns,
treads, etc., which end in pus formation which does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
get a pendant opening and destroys the tissues with
which it comes in contact. Finally it bursts, forms
sinuses and pipes, as commonly called, at the top of the
hoof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Extreme lameness, heat, pain and
swelling will show themselves about the top of the hoof.
As a rule a Quittor develops slowly and is more or less
painful during the first stages. After the sinus is formed
and the pus discharges, the inflammation generally subsides.
Its healing process is often delayed due to the
diseased portion of the cartilages inside the horny hoof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Apply Flaxseed or hot Bran poultices
to relieve the inflammation and hasten the formation of
sinuses or pipes. Then with an ordinary syringe inject
the following: Silver Nitrate, ten grains; Water, one
ounce. Inject fifteen to twenty drops twice daily. Keep
the food clean and the animal as quiet as possible. It is
very disagreeable, as stated before, and the healing is
very slow, but this must be naturally expected, as we are
unable to provide the sinuses with good drainage.</p>

<h2>RED WORM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Strongylus Tetracanthus</i>)</p>

<p>The Red Worm varies in length from one-third to
three and one-quarter inches, and is sometimes white,
though it usually appears to be red because of the blood it
contains. This parasite is found in all parts of the world.
Its favorite haunt is marshy land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Paleness of all visible membranes, eyes
watery and inflamed, swelling of the sheath, legs, and
lower surface of the belly; fetid diarrhoea, dullness, debility,
emaciation, rough coat, and the presence of worms
in the feces. The worms when first passed are bright
red in color but after being exposed to the air they turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
dark and may easily escape the notice of the casual observer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food for twenty-four
hours, then place the following drugs in a gelatin capsule:
Calomel, two drams, Barbadoes Aloes, three drams;
Ferri Sulphate, two drams. Give with capsule gun.
Also place the following tonic in their feed: Pulv.
Quassia, one ounce; Ferri Sulphate, two ounces; Pulv.
Anise Seed, two ounces. Mix and make sixteen powders.
Give one powder two or three times a day in the
feed.</p>

<h2>RHEUMATISM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to cold rains, drafts, lying on
damp ground when the blood is in poor condition. Also
due to over-stimulating food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Lameness, swelling or soreness which
may shift from one place to another, then finally locate
in or near one of the joints of the limbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Take away all grains and feed laxative
foods such as potatoes, carrots, apples, kale and good
hay. If the weather is warm turn out to pasture, but
confine in warm stable at night. It is advisable to give
a physic, as Aloin, two drams; Gentian, one dram; Ginger,
one dram. Place in gelatin capsule and give at one
dose with capsule gun, as its action on the blood has a
very good effect. When the swellings are painful, apply
Camphorated Liniment once or twice daily. Also, administer
the following tonic: Potassi Iodide, one ounce;
Nitrate of Potash, two ounces; Chlorate of Potash, two
ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce; Ferri Sulphate,
one ounce; Pulv. Anise Seed, four ounces. Mix well and
make into twenty powders. Give one powder three times
a day in bran or place in capsule and give with capsule
gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2>RING BONE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Faulty conformation—a narrow or straight
pastern joint is considered faulty. Be very careful
in selecting a sire when breeding, as faulty conformation
is hereditary. Ringbone may also result when
young animals are put to work on hard roads, or running
in stony pastures sometimes produces Ringbone
before the bones have become properly hardened. Other
causes are injury to tendons or ligaments, bruised joints,
blows, calking, or picking up a nail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Lameness will manifest itself when the
horse first starts out in the morning; this may become
less noticeable or even disappear temporarily as the animal
works. They gradually grow lamer and examination
will disclose an enlargement at or around the top of
the hoof. This may appear in one or more feet, but
the front feet are more often affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If the Ringbone is very much inflamed,
reduce the heat by applying cold water or ice
packs to the part. Clip off all hair from around the top
of the hoof and rub in well for twenty minutes the following:
Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulv. Cantharides,
two drams; Turpentine, one dram; Pine Tar,
two drams, and mix in two ounces of Lard. Apply the
ointment every two days for a week and repeat same
treatment in two weeks. Keeping the animal as quiet
as possible will hasten its recovery. If the animal is
comparatively young, recovery is certain, although the
enlargement may never disappear.</p>

<h2>ROUND WORM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Ascaris Megalcephala</i>)</p>

<p>Resembles the Earth Worm somewhat in shape, yellowish-white
in color, stiff and elastic. When full grown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it varies in length from six to sixteen inches. These
worms are usually found in the small intestines, although
they sometimes invade the stomach, and when numerous
seriously disturb the animal’s health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal’s general health is affected
as is evident from the morbid state of his appetite, rough
coat, pot-belly, liability to colic and slight diarrhoea.
Some of these worms are often expelled with the feces.
As they increase in number, they block up the small intestines,
giving rise to colic, and may in time kill the
horse. They sometimes cause perforation of the bowels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food from eighteen to
twenty-four hours, then administer the following: Ferri
Sulphate, two drams; Antimony Tartrate, two drams;
Pulv. Quassia, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule and
give with capsule gun. Follow this from six to eight
hours with Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two drams, and
give as above directed. It is a good plan to repeat the
above treatment in ten days to insure the removal of any
worms which may have survived the first treatment.</p>

<h2>SCROTAL RUPTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Inguinal Hernia</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Abnormal size of the upper ring through
which a part of the intestines or its connecting membrane
descends into and through the canal leading from the
abdomen to the scrotal cavity. There is little danger
of strangulation from this form of rupture which may
occur at birth and disappear with age. A careful examination
should therefore be made of the scrotum before
castration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—In most cases, this condition is easily
detected. The scrotum will be somewhat enlarged. Sometimes
the intestines will become strangulated and colicky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
symptoms appear. When a young male colt shows signs
of colic, examine him for Scrotal Rupture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The trouble usually disappears with
age although in some cases it is well to operate. Where
colicky symptoms are present, roll the colt on its back,
manipulating the scrotum. Diet carefully.</p>

<h2>SHOE BOIL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries, bruises or pressure when lying on
a rough floor. Sharp heeled shoes and kicks also have
a tendency to produce it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A hot painful swelling of the Elbow
joint when first noticed. When neglected, it takes on a
white fibrous or callous growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—First remove the cause. Do not lance
the enlargement; let it come to a head of its own accord,
by applying Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulv.
Cantharides, three drams; Lard, two ounces. Mix well
together and apply twice a week. When the swelling is
hot and painful it is well to apply cold water or ice packs
before applying the above mentioned prescription.</p>

<h2>SPLINTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This disease is chiefly produced by trotting
or running on hard ground, etc. It is evident that horses
with high knee action and heavy bodies are more liable
to this disease. Jumping is also a common cause of
splints, but the more accustomed a horse is to jumping
the less liable he is to throw splints, because practice
teaches the animal to regulate his movements so as to
more or less diminish the disagreeable if not actually
painful effect of concussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A splint is detected by grasping the
horse’s leg with the fingers upon one side and the thumb
upon the other, and tracing the inner and outer splint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bones from their heads downward to their tapering extremities.
Any actual enlargement will at once arrest
the hand; any rising or irregularity will create suspicion
and lead to close examination. Horses, especially young
ones which have lately been put to work, not infrequently
develop splints before any swelling appears. For this
reason, in examining a case of obscure lameness, particularly
if the animal is young, do not fail to look for the
sign of splint lameness, namely; that the lameness is abnormally
greater at a trot than at a walk and that the animal
usually fails to bend the knees freely and grows
worse with exercise. The last mentioned condition is
also present with corns, but an examination of the foot
will determine the question of their existence. In young
horses splints are sometimes mistaken for coffin-joint
lameness or navicular disease. To avoid this error, it
should be remembered that, when brought on by navicular
disease, the action of the limb improves with exercise;
also that horses of five years of age or less very
rarely suffer from coffin-joint disease. Some horses,
owing to unusual development of the inner splint bones
of the fore legs may appear to have splints, although
careful examination may prove both limbs to be free
from any bony deposit. When deciding such a point,
note if the two inner splint bones are of the same size.
Any swelling perceptible in a limb recently affected with
splint-lameness is usually attended by heat and pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If there is heat present, foment with
hot or cold water; when heat has subsided, apply the
following ointment: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams;
Turpentine, twenty drops; Lard two ounces, and mix.
Apply every forty-eight hours until three applications
have been applied. Rub in for twenty minutes each
time.</p>

<p>During this treatment use the horse for slow work on
soft roads, etc. As a rule the splints will not disappear at
once, but gradually. I may add that common splints
are not considered an unsoundness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2>SPASMODIC COLIC.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Horses seem to be predisposed to this form
of colic on account of the great length of their intestines
which are apt to be telescoped, twisted or their circular
muscular fibers spasmodically contracted. Perhaps the
principal cause is a change of food, sudden change of
temperature, constipation, drinking cold or too large a
quantity of water, especially if the animal is warm; overloading
the stomach with frozen or mouldy food. Worms
frequently produce colic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—If the animal is tied it will become uneasy,
paw, point its nose to the flank, twitch the tail, lie
down and get up frequently. If the animal is loose it will
walk around, paw, kick at its belly with the hind feet,
make attempts to lie down, roll on its back and remain
in that position for a while. The pulse increases with the
pain, temperature rises from one-half to one degree,
breathing labored and fast, the animal sweats in spots,
there may be diarrhoea present, but this does not frequently
occur.</p>

<p>Unfavorable symptoms of spasmodic colic are cold
legs to the feet, points of the ears cold, trembling of the
muscles, cold sweats, mucous membranes of the nose,
mouth and eyes have a dark color due to the congestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In all cases of spasmodic colic, except
where there is diarrhoea present or mares heavily in foal,
give Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in
gelatine capsule and give with capsule gun. It is advisable
to give rectal injection of Warm Water and Glycerine.
They are soothing and cooling to the intestinal
canal. Also give the following prescription: Pulv. Nux
Vomica, four ounces; Carbonate of Ammonia, four
ounces; Asafoetida, four ounces. Make into six powders;
place one powder in gelatin capsule and give with
capsule gun every two hours until relieved. The former
prescription removes the cause as it is a physic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
latter contains medicines blended so as to counteract
the spasmodic contractions of the bowels. It is also a
heart stimulant, just what is needed in colic to keep up
the animal’s vitality. Beware of colic remedies that are
given in drop doses. They contain drugs to relieve the
pain only and do not remove the cause. When their
effects are worn off, the disease has progressed; the animal’s
heart action has been weakened and chances are
that the animal will die. If drenching is resorted to, it
must be done with great precaution. Remember a horse
cannot breathe through its mouth.</p>

<h2>SIDE BONES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The chief causes of Side Bones are: Deprivation
of frog pressure, injuries, high heeled shoes, the
use of which is almost entirely confined to draft horses.
A high heeled shoe prevents the frog from resting on
the ground which is its natural support.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Enlargement just above the hoof,
usually affecting the front feet, or may affect only one
side of one of the feet. The pain which produces the
lameness is due to pressure on the soft tissues between
the newly formed side bone and the hoof. Sometimes
the enlargement has a tendency to spread the hoof. In
such a case the lameness is not so severe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Clip the hair from over the Side Bone
and rasp the foot below the enlargement, so that the hoof
will be flexible on pressure from the fingers. Then apply
the following to both the enlargement and the rasped
surface of the hoof: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams;
Pulv. Cantharides, four drams. Mix well in two ounces
of Lard and apply every forty-eight hours until three
applications have been applied.</p>

<p>If you must work the animal, put it to some easy
work where it has soft ground to walk upon.</p>

<h2>STAGGERS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Forage Poisoning—Inflammation of the Brain</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Cerebral Meningitis</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Certain plants or stagnant water are most
commonly instrumental in producing staggers; frequently
seen in the early autumn months when the grass
in the pastures becomes dry and certain forage remains
green which contains toxic principles. These plants are
ravenously eaten by horses on account of being green and
tender. This is one of the common causes of the disease,
although moldy, indigestible or highly nitrogenous
foods are frequently productive of staggers. This form
of staggers is not contagious, although what produces
staggers in one horse will also produce it in another. In
this way several horses may become affected with staggers
at the same time. Inflammation of the brain may
occur as a complication of some infectious or digestive
disease. Other causes are blows on the head, tumors in
or on the brain, which naturally cause the animal to
stagger, as the brain controls the horse’s power of locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—These vary to a certain extent, but a
careful observer will detect some trouble connected with
the nervous system, as the animal walking unsteadily,
stepping high and keeping the legs spread apart, bracing
itself to keep from falling. There is also great depression,
dullness and sleepiness with little or no inclination
to move about. The head may be placed against a
wall or fence and the legs kept moving as if the horse
were trying to walk. As the disease progresses and no
attempts are made to relieve it, they will become fractious,
nervous, easily excited, pawing and eventually fall,
keeping the feet moving as if walking, throwing their
heads about in a delirious manner and eventually death
follows. The horse as a rule eats and drinks ravenously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when the first signs of staggers are noticed, but in its
latter stages the tongue and gullet become paralyzed
and although the animal attempts to eat and drink he
cannot swallow. The pulse varies. It is strong, but subnormal
when the first symptoms of staggers are noticed,
that is to say, it is as slow as twenty to twenty-five
beats per minute. As the disease progresses, however,
it becomes weaker and faster. Constipation frequently
accompanies this disease, also paleness tinged with yellow
about the mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes.
In many instances I believe that the poisonous forage
eaten by horses depresses the heart action to such an extent
that it results in the brain not receiving the proper
blood supply, causing dizziness or staggers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the animal in a clean, dark stall,
keeping the surroundings as quiet as possible. In its
first stages it is easily treated, but as the horse becomes
easily excited and his swallowing becomes difficult, treatment
becomes more difficult. When the first signs are
noticed, administer a physic as: Aloin, two or three
drams; Ginger, two or three drams, according to the size
of the animal. Place in gelatin capsule and give with
capsule gun. This physic removes the irritant from the
intestines and prevents its absorption into the blood.
Also administer the following: Bromide of Potassium,
twelve ounces; Nitrate of Potash, four ounces; Iodide of
Potash, three ounces. Make into twenty-four capsules
and give one capsule every four hours.</p>

<p>My method of administering medicine to animals
places me in a position to treat them and compel them
to take the medicine even though paralysis may exist.
When animals will eat, feed food that is easily digested,
as hot wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats and vegetables
and give small quantities, but not often, of clean
fresh water. It is necessary to give stimulants and tonics
as soon as they are on the road to recovery, as Pulv. Nux
Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Sulphate of Iron, two ounces. Make into sixteen capsules
and give one capsule three times daily.</p>

<h2>STIFLE JOINT LAMENESS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Dislocation of the Patella</i>)</p>

<p>Although dislocations are infrequent, this is the most
common form which occurs in the horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Young loose jointed horses are predisposed
to dislocation of the stifle on account of the comparative
want of strength of their ligaments. They are much
more liable to this accident than older horses, especially
if they are in poor health or in rough hilly pastures; the
nature of which would naturally make them susceptible
to this injury, which, however, may take place as a result
of accident at any age. Young horses that suffer, off
and on from dislocation, often lose their liability with
increasing strength and age. This dislocation may be
partial or complete. In the former instance and the most
common is where the patella, or the little stifle bone that
glides in the groove composed of the lower hip and upper
thigh bones, has become partially dislocated or removed
from its natural position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—When the dislocation is complete the
affected limb is drawn forward, while the foot from the
pastern down is drawn backward, and the animal may
throw weight on it when made to move, which is accomplished
with great difficulty. When the dislocation is
partial, the symptoms are about the same as mentioned,
only the limb is less rigid. If the horse is moved, the
stifle makes a clicking sound. In this form both limbs
may be affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In partial dislocation, the stifle bone
may be replaced by drawing the leg forward, and with
the hand pressing in on the stifle. In complete dislocation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
tie a rope around the pastern of the affected leg,
then draw the rope through a collar placed around the
horse’s neck and draw forward as far as possible and
tie. Then press with both hands inward. After the
stifle is placed back into position use the following liniment:
Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of Turpentine,
four ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix
and apply well over the stifle joint once or twice a day for
two or three days. Feed nourishing food and put the
animal to slow, easy work or turn out to good pasture.</p>

<p>In chronic cases of Stifle Joint Lameness, treatment
is of no value, therefore, care for the animal as
soon as the catch in the walk or lameness appears.</p>

<h2>STRING-HALT.</h2>

<p><i>Cause.</i>—Several theories have been put forth as to
the cause of String-Halt which is generally supposed to
be a nervous disease; a condition opposite to paralysis.
The exact cause of this disease is hard to determine, but
it is likely to occur in highly nervous horses. It sometimes
follows an injury which may have irritated the
nerves in some way. I believe that castration causes it
in many instances, due to the severe struggle when being
thrown, or pulling down severely on the spermatic cord
when removing the testicle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Spasmodic contraction of one or both
limbs. This sign varies, as sometimes it is very violent,
while in others it may be so slight that it is hard to detect
when stepping the horse forward, but on backing or turning
the horse around the signs are easily noticed. All
symptoms are better marked in the winter than in the
summer, as some show it in the winter that do not show
it in the summer at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The feeding of laxative foods that are
easily digested relieves String-Halt in many instances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h2>SORE THROAT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Pharyngitis—Laryngitis</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to cold weather or rain when the
animal is not accustomed to it; drenching with irritating
medicines or inhaling irritating smoke or gases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—At first the animal generally chills, the
legs and ears are cold, but eventually they become very
warm as the temperature increases, coughing, grinding
of the teeth, saliva oozing from the mouth; the animal
will hold its head in a stiff straight position, moving it as
little as possible. There will be great difficulty in masticating
and swallowing, as the food will come from the
mouth in the form of wads, and as this soreness of the
throat progresses food will also come from the nostrils.
This is a bad sign, as extensive inflammation is no doubt
present. Water, also, runs through the nostrils freely
when the animal attempts to drink, due to the swollen
condition of the throat. The animal forces the water
back into the mouth, but is unable to swallow and hence
the water gushes out through the nostrils. The animal
evinces great pain when pressure is applied from the
outside and he breathes with great difficulty. Although
the pulse is not much affected at this stage, the temperature
is elevated from one to two degrees above normal.
The urine becomes scanty and highly colored, the eyes
congested and discharging. Eventually the throat becomes
greatly swollen and abscesses may form and discharge.
As a rule constipation is associated with this
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Mild attacks of sore throat are easily
treated, but when serious cases develop, treatment is unsuccessful.
Place the animal in a clean, comfortable stall;
permit as much fresh air as possible, but avoid all drafts.
If the weather is chilly, blanket the animal, hand rub the
legs and bandage with woolen cloths or bandages. Administer
a mixture made from Chlorate of Potash, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
ounces; Nitrate of Potash, three ounces; Tannic Acid,
one-half ounce; Molasses, one-half pint; Pine Tar, one-half
pint. Mix well and place about one tablespoonful
on the tongue every two hours in severe cases; in mild
attacks, give less frequently. When they will eat, feed
food that is easily digested, as hot wheat bran mashes
and steamed rolled oats containing two or three ounces of
pure ground flaxseed. It is always necessary to apply
strong liniments to the throat, as they relieve inflammation
and stimulate the formation of an abscess. The
following liniment will be found very beneficial: Aqua
Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four
ounces; Sweet Oil, six ounces; shake well and apply two
or three times daily. If the swelling is extreme between
the jaws, so as to interfere with the animal’s breathing,
it is well to lance the abscess if a soft spot can be found.
Just cut through the skin with a knife; then use a clean
blunt instrument to locate the pus cavity. Otherwise,
severe hemorrhage may be produced.</p>

<h2>SURFEIT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Nettle-Rash—Urtecaria</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The usual cause of Surfeit is supposed to be
due to a character of food consumed which upsets the
animal’s digestive organs, the skin being continuous
with the mucous membranes lining the intestinal canal.
A disturbance of one structure is readily communicated
to the other. Apparently, owing to the extremely dry nature
of the forage during the greater part of the year,
horses in the United States frequently suffer from Surfeit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Surfeit is a term applied to an eruption
of small irregular humps or boils which are more or less
painful to the touch and which break out suddenly as a
rule on the horse’s body and neck, and in rare cases on
the legs. A favorite seat of Surfeit is the parts covered
with the harness or saddle and along the neck and withers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Surfeit is very troublesome and annoys both the
horse and driver, especially when the horse perspires, as
he will rub violently when coming in contact with any
object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Give two to four ounces of Epsom
Salts in hot wheat bran mashes every morning. Feed as
much sloppy food as possible, vegetables, etc. Avoid
feeding dry woody hay, as it irritates the intestines and
aggravates the disease.</p>

<h2>SWEENEY.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Atrophy</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—An ill fitting collar, one tug longer than
the other, striking an object when pulling, like a stone
or a corner of a building, slipping, kicks, or the animal
may have a splint, sprain, ringbone, sidebone, coffin-joint
lameness, curb, corns, stifle lameness, in fact anything
that tends to make an animal favor the use of certain
muscles. It is not a disease, just a lack in the development
of the muscles, which waste away or shrink when
not used as nature provided. For instance, perhaps you
have had or have seen persons that had a fractured leg
or arm the muscles of which through lack of use had
wasted away (Atrophy), until they were used normally
for sometime, when the muscles again came back to their
normal size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—First locate the cause. The animal may
be very lame although I have seen Sweeneys where lameness
was very hard to detect, being those which were
usually due to ill fitting collars. Remember you can have
a Sweeney of the hip as well as the shoulder, and keep
in mind the above mentioned cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When you have an animal affected
with Sweeney, find the true cause and remove it if possible.
Unless the Sweeney is a chronic one, it is
successfully treated with Aqua Ammonia Fort., four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ounces; Turpentine, four ounces; Sweet Oil, four ounces.
Mix and apply well over wasted muscles once a day. If
the application is too irritating, as some horses have
thinner skins than others, it is advisable to add more
Sweet Oil than above mentioned.</p>

<h2>TAPEWORM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Taenia</i>)</p>

<p>These worms have been found in the horse, but so
rarely that they need not be considered.</p>

<h2>THOROUGHPIN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Generally due to some irritation of the hock
joint such as severe sprains from animal jumping, slipping,
kick or falling through a culvert or bridge or it is
frequently hereditary; so be very careful in choosing a
sire when breeding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Sometimes there is lameness when the
Thoroughpin is first noticed, but it will gradually disappear
as soon as the inflammation ceases. There will be
a puffy, soft enlargement which occurs at the upper and
back part of the hock, beneath the great tendons. Generally
both sides are enlarged and puffy, but occasionally
it happens that one side only is involved. Thoroughpin
is also a forerunner of Bog Spavin, as they generally are
connected; as you are aware the hock contains joint
oil as all other joints do, retained in place by a thin, white
fibrous membrane. Irritation of the hock joint tends to
develop an extra large quantity of joint oil, and the hock
is less protected by tendons where a Thoroughpin or Bog
Spavin occurs—hence those puffy swellings are filled
with joint oil and are connected. If you press on one
side of a Thoroughpin, you will see the other side bulge
out. If you press on a Bog Spavin and there is a Thoroughpin
present, you will see it bulge on either side of
the Thoroughpin—or vice vers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>a.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If on an old horse and the Thoroughpin
is of long standing, treatment is unsatisfactory, but
on the other hand, if the animal is young it can be successfully
treated with Tincture of Iodine, one ounce;
Gum Camphor, two ounces; Gasolene, one pint. Mix
well and rub in with nail or tooth brush twice a week.
Keep the animal quiet as possible, as the results will be
accomplished much sooner. Never attempt to open or
lance a puffy swelling about a joint, as it contains joint
oil. The result would be an open joint.</p>

<h2>THRUSH.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The two main causes of Thrush are lack of
pressure on the frog and the decomposing effect of filth
and fermentation of organic matter which accumulates in
the cleft of the frog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal in some cases is lame; there
will be a swelling accompanied by a very fetid discharge;
in some cases the frog has practically rotted away; there
will be more or less inflammation in the foot. The legs
may even swell. Thrush is more frequently found in the
hind feet because of the manure and filth with which they
must come in contact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Cut away all loose pieces of horn from
over the frog and apply a Flaxseed meal poultice and
leave it on for twenty-four hours, after which wash well
with Soap and warm water. Then apply Calomel to the
groove in the frog. Keep the foot clean. Do not allow
the animal to stand in filth.</p>

<h2>WIND COLIC.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Flatulent Colic</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This dangerous form of Colic is a distension
of the bowels with gas, resulting generally from the decomposition
of undigested food in the bowels. It sometimes
follows Spasmodic Colic, in which there is first
spasms due to the irritations set up by the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
undigested matter, and subsequently this food decomposes
and forms gas. I may conclude that Flatulent or
Wind Colic is usually caused by errors in feeding and
watering horses. Perhaps the animal has been given
large quantities of rank grass, watery roots, which on
account of its moist nature is quickly swallowed without
being properly masticated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The signs resemble those of Spasmodic
Colic, except that they are less violent. In most cases
there is general accumulation of gas, the abdomen distended
to a considerable size before the animal shows
signs of uneasiness. In cases where the animal swells
on the right side, it is the large intestines filled with
gas. In other cases where both sides are equally swollen,
the stomach and small intestines contain gas. The
horse’s back will have an arched appearance, passing gas
from the anus frequently, and the horse will make attempts
to vomit. In some cases actual vomiting takes
place. This is a bad sign, as rupture of the stomach
usually occurs at this stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Give Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two
drams, in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.
However, this is a physic and should not be given to
mares heavily in foal. Also apply to the abdominal cavity
liniment consisting of Aqua Ammonia Fort., four
ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four ounces; Sweet Oil, four
ounces. Mix and rub in well over the abdomen.</p>

<p>To mares heavy with foal, apply the above liniment
and give rectal injections of Glycerine and warm water
frequently.</p>

<p>The following remedy should be administered to all
cases of Colic, including mares heavy with foal: Aromatic
Spirits of Ammonia, six ounces; Turpentine, six
ounces. Mix well together and place one ounce in gelatin
capsule and give with capsule gun every hour. Puncturing
the intestines is advisable in some cases to relieve
them of gas. This requires a special instrument for the
purpose and no one should attempt to perform the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
unless they know the anatomy of the part, as the
arteries of the intestines may be penetrated, and produce
internal hemorrhage or infection of the intestines, or
abscesses may follow.</p>

<h2>WIND GALLS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—By concussions from fast work on hard
roads and from sprains from slipping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—When concussions alone are responsible,
the suspensory ligament and the back tendons will at
first be in a normal condition, and the swelling will probably
be confined to both the inside and outside of the leg
and may be felt in the form of a puffy swelling on each
side of the fetlock by placing the fore finger and the
thumb on the joint. In more serious cases resulting from
sprains, the vacant space between the back tendons and
the suspensory ligament may also become filled with
fluids. In other words, a Wind Gall has formed. In
some cases the animal may be lame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When there is heat present apply
cold, wet packs until the heat disappears. Then apply
Tincture of Iodine, one ounce; Gum Camphor, two
ounces; to one pint of Gasolene. Apply every three
days with nail or tooth brush. Shake contents of the
bottle well each time before applying.</p>

<p>I may add that this is a very difficult blemish to treat
and is not always successful, so do not be discouraged if
the enlargements do not disappear, but the above prescription
has proven the most successful of any treatment
I have personally used in my private practice.</p>

<h2>WOUNDS.</h2>

<p>Wounds caused by external injuries have a general
resemblance, and whether clean-cut, punctured, lacerated,
poisonous, gunshot, etc., require practically the
same treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Wash with a Carbolic solution, one
tablespoonful to one pint of distilled water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sewing of Wounds.</span>—I cannot say that I am in
favor of sewing wounds unless they are gaping or wide
open.</p>

<p>After the wound is washed, dust with Iodoform, Boracic
Acid and Tannic Acid, each one ounce. Powder
finely and place in a sifter top can and apply twice daily.
Cord or heavy thread may be used for sewing the wound
after being saturated in a Carbolic Acid solution, using
a large needle. If the animal is vicious, place a
twitch on his nose or it may be necessary to throw him.</p>

<h2>Transcriber’s Note</h2>

<p>There were a number of printing errors with this book, where lines were
transposed or printed on the wrong page entirely.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_9">Page 9</a>, the line “ones, as for instance, an elephant’s pulse rate is from”
was originally printed on page 35 in the middle of a sentence:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30em;">

<p class="noindent"><span style="margin-left: 23em;">“The ani-</span><br />
[ones, as for instance, an elephant’s pulse rate is from]<br />
mal falls off in condition in most cases.”</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Page_11">Page 11</a>, some erroneously inserted text has been removed:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30em;">

<p class="noindent">“or hot bran, flaxseed or vegetable poultices. [It is com-<br />
hot bran, flaxseed or vegetable poultices] It will usually”</p>

</div>

<p>The last line of <a href="#Page_52">page 52</a> [possibly be bestowed upon the animal. The after-treat-]
was originally printed as the first line of page 53, and the first line of page
53 [ment consists of allowing a liberal quantity of good nu-] appeared in its place.
These have been reversed in order.</p>

<p>In the index, the entry for “Worm, Pin” was originally printed under M, and indeed
the entries on the various types of “Worm” were all out of alphabetical order,
so this has been fixed.</p>

<p>A few other minor typographical errors were also corrected.</p>
